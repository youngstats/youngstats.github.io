  title         = "Convex integration and phenomenologies in turbulence",
  author        = "Buckmaster, Tristan and Vicol, Vlad",
  abstract      = "In this review article we discuss a number of recent results
                   concerning wild weak solutions of the incompressible Euler
                   and Navier-Stokes equations. These results build on the
                   groundbreaking works of De Lellis and
                   Sz\textbackslash'ekelyhidi Jr., who extended Nash's
                   fundamental ideas on $C^1$ flexible isometric embeddings,
                   into the realm of fluid dynamics. These techniques, which go
                   under the umbrella name convex integration, have fundamental
                   analogies the phenomenological theories of hydrodynamic
                   turbulence. Mathematical problems arising in turbulence
                   (such as the Onsager conjecture) have not only sparked new
                   interest in convex integration, but certain experimentally
                   observed features of turbulent flows (such as intermittency)
                   have also informed new convex integration constructions.
                   First, we give an elementary construction of nonconservative
                   $C^\{0+\}_\{x,t\}$ weak solutions of the Euler equations,
                   first proven by De Lellis-Sz\textbackslash'ekelyhidi Jr..
                   Second, we present Isett's recent resolution of the flexible
                   side of the Onsager conjecture. Here, we in fact follow the
                   joint work of De Lellis-Sz\textbackslash'ekelyhidi Jr. and
                   the authors of this paper, in which weak solutions of the
                   Euler equations in the regularity class $C^\{\frac
                   13-\}_\{x,t\}$ are constructed, attaining any energy
                   profile. Third, we give a concise proof of the authors'
                   recent result, which proves the existence of infinitely many
                   weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes in the regularity class
                   $C^0_t L^\{2+\}_x \cap C^0_t W^\{1,1+\}_x$. We conclude the
                   article by mentioning a number of open problems at the
                   intersection of convex integration and hydrodynamic
                   turbulence.",

               dimensions, d $\geq$ 2. The tendency of two-point distances and
               of tangent vectors to shrink or expand is related to the
               dimension and the proportion of the flow that is solenoidal or
               potential. Tangent vectors from the same point tend to become
               aligned in the same or opposite directions. The purely potential
               flows are characterized by an analogue of the curl-free
               property. Liapounov exponents are treated briefly. The rate of
               increase or decrease of the length of an arc of small diameter
               is related to the shape of the arc. In the case d = 2 a

               evolution equations in infinite dimensional, typically Hilbert
               and Banach, spaces. In the first part the authors give a
               self-contained exposition of the basic properties of probability
               measure on separable Banach and Hilbert spaces, as required
               later; they assume a reasonable background in probability theory

               devoted to the existence and uniqueness of solutions of a
               general stochastic evolution equation, and the third concerns
               the qualitative properties of those solutions. Appendices gather

              Under mild restrictions on the geometry of the scales forced, we
              show that any finite?dimensional projection of the solution
              possesses a smooth, strictly positive density with respect to
              Lebesgue measure. In particular, our conditions are viscosity
              independent. We are mainly interested in forcing that excites a
              very small number of modes. All of the results rely on proving
              the nondegeneracy of the infinite?dimensional Malliavin matrix. ?

abstract="In this paper we review and discuss the role of Lagrangian chaos in creating multifractal measures associated with spatial intermittency. In particular, we consider (1) passive scalars, (2) the kinematic magnetic dynamo problem, and (3) the stability of high Reynolds number fluid flows. In all cases we take the underlying flow to be smooth in the sense that it has no fractal or power law properties of its own (its wavenumber power spectrum is peaked at some low value and decays with increasing wavenumber much faster than a power law, e.g., exponentially). Nevertheless, chaos in the Lagrangian dynamics of such flows can lead to fractals and power law wavenumber spectra for relevant physical quantities, such as the distribution of the passive scalar (problem (1)), the magnetic field (problem (2)), and the vorticity field (problem (3)). A key concept used in the quantitative treatment of these problems is that of finite time Lyapunov exponents. This paper will illustrate how consideration of finite time Lyapunov exponents can be used to quantitatively analyze these situations. Thus we provide a connection between quantities of physical interest and ergodic dynamical characterization of the underlying chaos of the flow. In the case of problem (3), we also comment on implications for high Reynolds number fluid turbulence.",

               the result of this transport over a set of random trajectories.
