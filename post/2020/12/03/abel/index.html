<p><em>The Hungarian Central Statistical Office uses online cash register data
for the measurement of retail trade and food services. The data source
allows the statistical office to considerably cut administrative burden
of data providers without quality loss in retail trade statistics.
Online cash register data is widely used in tracking the latest
developments in retail trade during the coronavirus pandemic as well.</em></p>
<p>Online cash registers (online pénztárgép &ndash; OPG) were introduced in
Hungary in 2013. The goal of the measure was to give the Tax Authority a
real-time distant insight into the turnover of a retail traders and food
service providers. By the introduction of the online cash registers a
substantial whitening was expected in the sense of lessening the extent
of non-accounted sales. According to a study<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> published a few years
ago examining the effect of the introduction of online cash registers,
68% of the online cash register users were involved in retail trade and
food services and they represented 83% of the total turnover observed by
online cash registers in 2015. The authors concluded that online cash
registers resulted in bigger rise in turnover in comparison to
enterprises not using such a tool. The median increase was 15 percent in
the case of retail trade turnover and 20 in food services, respectively.
The whitening of the turnover, however, started even before the
deployment of the online cash registers, especially in food services
sector and among smaller enterprises.</p>
<p>The Hungarian Central Statistical Office (hereinafter: HCSO) uses online
cash register data for the calculation of retail trade and food
services. The methodology is widely-used for the measurement of turnover
and the production of indices by measuring retail trade and food
services turnover based on online cash register data. Simplified
questionnaire for data collection is still used in the case of fully
observed data providers. In the simplified questionnaire HCSO asks for
unbroken turnover data of statistical units. This questionnaire serves
as correction for eventually missing online cash register data and
measurement of online trade. A full questionnaire is sent to designated
companies whose activities are not covered by the online cash register
system or do not use a cash register. The full questionnaire also
provides the correction of low-level data quality. This twofold
approach, in fact, makes online cash register data a supplementary data
source, opens the floor for the cut of data providers&rsquo; administrative
burdens and ensures a firm ground for calculable production of retail
trade statistics (i.e. to mitigate risk of loss of administrative data).
Due to the introduction of the new method almost an 80% cut could be
achieved in the number of the data providers, observed units and
questionnaire cells.</p>
<p>The newly applied method proved to be reliable. Examining the testing
period, the monthly retail trade turnover data on current prices and
prepared on the basis of the online cash register data was 0.9-4.4%
lower than those measured using the traditional method (i.e.
questionnaire). This implied that the old method might trustworthily be
replaced by the new method, no information setback and quality loss was
expected.</p>

<p>Time series show that the difference slightly varied by product groups
but neither considerable shift was observed, nor divergence in long term
trends. As shown on the graph below, turnover indices totally overlap in
the case of food and fuel retail trade, while in the case of non-food
products the difference is also negligible.</p>

<p>Similarly to the turnover data the new method has neither resulted in
deviation of volume indices. The below graph shows that no considerable
difference was measured between the questionnaire based method and
online cash register data.</p>

<p>Based on the above outcomes HCSO considered the new method applicable
for the measurement of retail trade turnover. The transition, on the
other hand, has taken more years during which period parallel use of the
two methods was applied.</p>
<p>It is also worth to be mentioned that HCSO utilises online cash register
data for the monitoring of retail trade trends during the coronavirus
pandemic. For these purposes daily data are used and the latest
developments of turnover changes in retail trade might be tracked
thereby. The main advantage of the usage of online cash register data
compared to VAT data is obviously that cash register data are available
on a daily basis and might indicate changes in the composition of trade
faster. The next graph shows the periodical change of several products
expressed in the value of retail trade turnover, based on online cash
register data.</p>
