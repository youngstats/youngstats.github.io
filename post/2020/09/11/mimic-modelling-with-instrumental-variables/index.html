<p><strong>MIMIC modelling with instrumental variables: A 2SLS-MIMIC approach</strong></p>
<p>By Andrej Srakar, Marilena Vecco, Miroslav Verbič, Montserrat Gonzalez
Garibay and Jože Sambt</p>
<p><em>Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) models are type of
structural equation models to estimate causality in a DAG framework. In
a common MIMIC model, multiple indicators reflect the underlying latent
variables/factors, and the multiple causes (observed predictors) affect
latent variables/factors. Basic assumptions of MIMIC are clearly
violated in case of a variable being both an indicator and a cause. To
resolve the situation, we utilize a version of Bollen's 2SLS estimator
combined with Jöreskog method of the analysis of covariance structures.
Our 2SLS empirical estimation is based on static MIMIC specification but
we point also to error-correction 2SLS MIMIC specification. We present
basic properties of the estimator and apply findings to empirical case
of precarious status of older workers which solves an important issue of
the definition of precarious work as a multidimensional concept, not
modelled adequately so far.</em></p>
<p>Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) models are type of
structural equation models, a theory-based approach to confirm the
influence of a set of exogenous causal variables on the latent variable,
and also the effect of the latent variable on observed indicator
variables (see e.g. Zellner, 1970; Goldberger, 1972; Jöreskog and
Goldberger, 1975; Weck, 1983; Frey and Weck, 1983; Frey and
Weck-Hannemann, 1984; Aigner et al., 1988; for some more recent
applications see e.g. Lester, 2008; Proitsi et al., 2009; Rose and
Spiegel, 2010). MIMIC models are commonly used in economics for
modelling the underground economy (for discussion on this topic see e.g.
Thomas, 1992; Schneider, 1994; 1997; 2003; 2005; Lippert and Walker,
1997; Johnson et al., 1998a, 1998b; Tanzi, 1999; Giles, 1999; Mummert
and Schneider, 2001; Giles and Tedds, 2002; Giles et al., 2002;
Dell&rsquo;Anno and Schneider, 2003; Buehn and Schneider, 2008; Barbosa et
al., 2013; Nchor and Adamec, 2015; Breusch, 2016).</p>
<p>In a common MIMIC model, multiple indicators reflect the underlying
latent variables/factors, and the multiple causes (observed predictors)
affect latent variables/factors. Basic assumptions of MIMIC are clearly
violated in case of a variable being both an indicator and a cause, i.e.
in the presence of reverse causality. Furthermore, the model is then
unidentified. To resolve the situation, which can arise frequently (for
example, in modelling shadow economy, GDP can be both a predictor and
consequence), we utilize a version of Bollen's (1996) 2SLS estimator
for structural equation models combined with Jöreskog (1970)'s method
of the analysis of covariance structures to derive a new, 2SLS estimator
for MIMIC models. As MIMIC estimation lacks closed form solutions for
parameters we study and use Madansky-Hägglund-Jöreskog and Bollen's IV
and 2SLS approaches to estimate the covariance matrices of latent
variables. Second, we use this estimated covariance matrix of the latent
variables and apply Jöreskog's (1970) maximum likelihood procedure to
estimate coefficient estimates for the latent variable model.</p>
<p>The formal mathematical representation of the MIMIC model reads as
follows (see e.g. Hodge and Traiman, 1968; Jöreskog and Goldberger,
1975):</p>
<p>$$y^{*} = \alpha^{'}x + \epsilon\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)$$</p>
<p>$$y = \beta y^{*} + u\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2)$$</p>
<p>where $y = (y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,\ y_{p})&lsquo;$ are indicators of the latent
variable $y^{*}$ and $x = (x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,\ x_{q})&lsquo;$ are causes of
$y^{*}$.</p>
<p>The model is based on the following assumptions (see e.g. Jöreskog and
Goldberger, 1975; Trebicka, 2014):</p>
<p>$E\left( \epsilon u^{'} \right) = 0'$,
$E\left( \epsilon^{2} \right) = \sigma^{2}$,
$E\left( uu^{'} \right) = \Theta^{2}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }(3)$</p>
<p>Clearly, if $x$ and $y$ are in endogeneous relationship, for example if
both have an influence to each other (so-called reverse causality)
assumptions in (3) are violated. In this case it is also impossible to
identify the relationships in (1) and (2). Applications of MIMIC models,
typically, also make distributional assumptions, for example that the
joint distribution of the variables is Gaussian, the relation is linear,
and each measured variable and each latent common cause has specific
sources of variance that are independent of the sources of variance
specific to other variables (Trebicka, 2014).</p>
<p>In his seminal article, Bollen (1996) constructs a new 2SLS estimator
for structural equation models, based on limited information maximum
likelihood, as follows. His initial latent variable model reads as:</p>
<p>$$\eta = \alpha + B\eta + \Gamma\xi + \zeta\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (4)$$</p>
<p>where $\eta$ is an $m \times 1$ vector of latent endogenous random
variables, $B$ is a $m \times m$ matrix of coefficients that give the
impact of the $\eta$'s on each other, $\xi$ is an $n \times 1$ vector
of latent exogenous variables, $\Gamma$ is the $m \times n$ coefficient
matrix giving $\xi$'s impact on $\eta$, $\alpha$ is an $m \times 1$
vector of intercept terms, and $\zeta$ is an $m \times 1$ vector of
random disturbances with the $\mathbb{E}\left( \zeta \right) = 0$ and
$\text{Cov}\left( \xi,\zeta^{'} \right) = 0$.</p>
<p>Writing $y_{1} = \eta + \varepsilon_{1}$ and $x_{1} = \xi + \delta_{1}$
Bollen considers a single equation from $y_{1}$ as:</p>
<p>$$y_{i} = \alpha_{i} + B_{i}y_{1} + \Gamma_{i}x_{1} + u_{i}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (5)$$</p>
<p>where $y_{i}$ is the $i$-th $y$ from $y_{1}$, $\alpha_{i}$ is the
corresponding intercept, $B_{i}$ is the $i$-th row from $By_{1}$,
$\Gamma_{i}$ is the $i$-th row from $\Gamma$, and $u_{i}$ is the $i$-th
element from $u$.</p>
<p>As ordinary least squares is inappropriate for this estimation, we can
use two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator as an alternative and
consistent estimator of the parameters.</p>
<p>The 2SLS estimator require instrumental variables for $Z_{i}$. They must
be: a) correlated with $Z_{i}$, b) uncorrelated with $u_{i}$, and c)
sufficient in number so that there at least as many IV's as the number
of explanatory variables on the right-hand side of the equation.
Generally, in Bollen's 2SLS estimation, the pool of potential IVs comes
from those $y$'s and $x$'s not included in $Z_{i}$ (excluding, of
course, $y_{i}$). The exceptions are any variables in $Z_{i}$ that are
uncorrelated with $u_{i}$, since such variables can serve as IVs.
Exogenous (predetermined) $x$'s would be an example of IVs that might
appear on the right-hand side above.</p>
<p>The above Following Buehn and Schneider (2008), we can write the
variance-covariance matrix of the 2SLS-MIMIC as:</p>
<p>$$\Sigma^{<em>} = \begin{bmatrix} \Phi^{</em>} &amp; \Phi^{<em>}\alpha^{</em>}\beta^{'} \<br>
\beta{\alpha^{<em>}}^{'}\Phi^{</em>} &amp; \left( 1 + {\rho^{*}}^{2} \right)\beta\beta^{'} + \Theta^{2} \<br>
\end{bmatrix}\text{\ \ }\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (6)$$</p>
<p>$$\Phi^{*} = X^{'}P_{X}\text{X\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (7)$$</p>
<p>$$\rho^{<em>} = {\alpha^{</em>}}^{'}X^{'}P_{X}X\alpha^{*}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (8)$$</p>
<p>$${\widehat{\alpha}}^{*} = \left( \frac{1}{{\widehat{\kappa}}^{2}} \right){(X^{'}P_{X}X)}^{- 1}X^{'}P_{X}Y{\widehat{\Omega}}^{- 1}\widehat{\beta}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (9)$$</p>
<p>$$P_{X} = X{(X^{'}X)}^{- 1}X^{'}$$</p>
<p>This covariance structure may be specified in terms of Jöreskog's model
of covariance structures by setting:</p>
<p>$$B = (\begin{matrix}
I_{k \times k} &amp; 0_{k \times 1} \<br>
0_{m \times k} &amp; \beta_{m \times 1} \<br>
\end{matrix}), \Lambda = (\begin{matrix}
I_{k \times k} \<br>
{{\alpha^{*}}^{'}}_{1 \times k} \<br>
\end{matrix})$$,</p>
<p>$\Psi = (\begin{matrix}
0_{k \times k} &amp; 0_{k \times 1} \<br>
0_{1 \times k} &amp; I_{1 \times 1} \<br>
\end{matrix})$, $\Theta = \begin{pmatrix}
0_{k \times k} &amp; 0_{k \times m} \<br>
0_{m \times k} &amp; \Theta_{m \times m} \<br>
\end{pmatrix}\ \ \ (1)$</p>
<p>and taking $\Phi^{*}$ free.</p>
<p>The final parameter estimation is performed following Jöreskog and
Goldberger (1975)'s suggestion of using maximum likelihood estimation,
firstly transforming the above problem into Jöreskog (1970)'s
covariance structure modelling framework. As the data entering
2SLS-MIMIC estimation are independent and identically distributed, we
can apply reasoning of Lee and Shi (1998) and argue that the derived
estimator is consistent, asymptotically normal and efficient. This shows
the consistency of our procedure and main properties of the derived
estimation process which guarantee the desired behavior of the
estimates.</p>
<p>Similar procedure can be used to transform the dynamic/error-correction
problem into Jöreskog's algorithm and show that the estimator derived
there is also consistent and asymptotically normal.</p>
<p>Below are results of a simple simulation based on 10000 simulated data
sets and corresponding 1000 resamples. We simulate three criteria of the
MIMIC models: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA),
standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) and comparative fit index
(CFI). We simulate three scenarios: 1) with short time series (t=20) and
with only one I(1) variable; 2) with short time series (t=20) and
several (three) I(1) variables; 3) with longer time series (t=100) and
several (three) I(1) variables.</p>

<p>In an application we study case of precarious work of the elderly using
the theoretical model on below picture.</p>

<p>The results enable us to calculate the levels of precarious work of the
elderly by European countries, included in the SHARE survey (Wave 6)
which is one first such attempts in the empirical literature so far.</p>

<p>The article presented is to our knowledge the second one (first one
being Tekwe et al., 2014 &ndash; their article addressed endogeneity in MIMIC
in a very limited context related specifically to measurement error
problems) which explicitly models reverse causality in MIMIC models
which can arise very frequently. We present a novel estimation
procedure, based on Bollen's 2SLS estimator and transformation into
Jöreskog's general covariance structure analysis. We are able to derive
three new estimation procedures and show their consistency and
asymptotic normality (for 2SLS-MIMIC).</p>
<p>We have to mention several limitations of the study. Firstly, there
exist significant critiques of the method of MIMIC for estimating shadow
economy and other concepts. As has been shown by e.g. Breusch (2016),
MIMIC is not always a proper modelling technique to estimate the latent
concepts under question. Also, the IV context could be developed in more
depth, related to overidentification issues and including estimators
such as LIML, FIML, 3SLS and different types of GMM approaches.
Furthermore, we address only maximum likelihood MIMIC estimation and do
not relate to other two approaches at hand: econometric and factor
analytic one (mentioned already in the original article of Jöreskog and
Goldberger, 1975). For future work it would be important to address also
those points more properly.</p>
