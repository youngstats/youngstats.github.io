<p><em>As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the world at the beginning of
2020, statistically modeling its development became of big interest. The
main focus of this work was to analyze the spread of the disease and its
main characteristics for Slovenia using publicly available COVID-19
data. Our work takes a Bayesian semiparametric approach using which we
estimate some of the main measures of interest for the pandemic (e.g.
the reproduction number <code>$R_{t}$</code>) and give accurate forecasts of
important indicators for the following days. The provided methodology
gives a flexible approach for modeling the COVID-19 pandemic which can
be further adapted given the epidemiological and data specifics for a
certain country.</em></p>
<p>The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has quickly spread all around the world
greatly impacting all aspects of our lives. One of the key reasons for
its rapid spread is the high reproduction number of infection,
<code>$R_{t}$</code>. The <code>$R_{t}$</code> value represents the average number of people
that an individual infects during their infection period, whereby <code>$t$</code>
represents time. <code>$R_{t}$</code> is susceptible to change, for example, due to
non-pharmaceutical governmental interventions (e.g. school closure or
complete lockdown). When <code>$R_{t} &lt; 1$</code>, the incidence of new cases
reduces, but when <code>$R_{t} &gt; 1$</code>, it increases until the epidemic reaches
its peak; after that, the incidence of new cases starts to reduce due to
(at least temporal) <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Modern%20Epidemiology&amp;publication_year=2015&amp;author=K.%20Rothman&amp;author=S.%20Greenland&amp;author=T.%20Lash">herd
immunity</a>.
The estimates of the basic (i.e. initial) reproduction number, <code>$R_{0}$</code>,
for SARS-CoV-2 vary substantially, depending on the method of
estimation, and stand at about 3. Such a high basic reproduction number
leads to a steep exponential increase in the number of cases which, in
turn, causes a rapid increase in the number of people in need of
hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU). Due to the limited
capacities of the healthcare system, this can lead to a situation where
it is impossible to provide suitable care to all patients in need. Thus,
it is of crucial importance for policymakers to estimate $R_{t}$ by
which the spread of the epidemic could be monitored. But for better
understanding of the epidemiological characteristics, we are also
interested in estimating further measures, e.g. the infection fatality
rate (i.e. the proportion of deaths among infected individuals), the
proportion of asymptomatic cases and forecasting the number of
hospitalized patients and patients in the ICUs.</p>
<p><strong>Figure</strong> <strong>1 Number of patients treated in hospitals and ICUs on a
given date, cumulative number of deaths and cumulative number of deaths
occurring in hospitals in Slovenia, March 4&ndash;June 3, 2020.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/post/2020/10/01/modeling-covid-19/image1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the current COVID-19 pandemic many governments have adopted
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control the spread of the
epidemic in their countries. Many models are available for forecasting
the COVID-19 pandemic with adopted NPIs, e.g. SIR-like
(Susceptible&ndash;Infected&ndash;Recovered-like) compartmental models or
network-based models, which mimic the behavior of all individuals in the
population. Models based on Bayesian inference were also introduced as
an alternative to these two approaches. Here, simple stochastic models
which describe the key features of epidemic spread are formulated and
then actual data are used to estimate the parameters of the model, thus
allowing the analysis to be driven by data and using less assumptions
and/or fixed parameters. Furthermore, the final estimates are equipped
with statistically sound intervals of uncertainty.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the epidemic, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7">Flaxman et
al.</a> studied the
influence of NPIs relying on Bayesian inference, using data for 11
European countries. Although this work gave very promising results it
did have some flaws that would be problematic for the case of Slovenia.
The Flaxman model is solely driven by the amount of deaths, which for a
country of size like Slovenia does not provide a lot of information.
Thus it was of main interest to include additional available data
sources for Slovenia to make outputs as accurate as possible. In our
work we have additionally included the following data sources: confirmed
number of cases, number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care,
and number of patients admitted to and released from hospitals and ICUs.
Some of this information is presented on Figure 1 with data up to and
including June 3, 2020 (all results presented in this report are up
until this date).</p>
<p><strong>Figure</strong> <strong>2 Estimated 50% and 90% credible intervals for the
reproduction number</strong> <code>$R_{t}$</code> <strong>for Slovenia March 4&ndash;June 3, 2020, with
marked days of NPIs:</strong> G1 (March 10, 2020; public events banned), G2
(March 20, 2020; implementation of complete lock-down), G3 (March 30,
2020; prohibition of movement outside of the municipality of residence),
G4 (April 30, 2020; some restrictions start to relax)</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020/10/01/modeling-covid-19/image2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In our work we have proposed an elaborated semiparametric modeling
framework based on a Bayesian approach, that greatly extends and
modifies the Flaxman model. Apart from allowing for multiple data
sources in the model, we also relax the assumption that the reproduction
number <code>$R_{t}$</code> is piece-wise constant; rather, we model it as
time-varying. The extended model also allows us to report other
measures, such as the proportion of unidentified cases, infection
fatality rate, the proportion of cumulatively infected people and the
number of patients in different disease progression states in time. In
this report, we do not provide exact definitions and technical details
for the proposed model, but full details are available in the articles
cited below.</p>
<p>We first report on the estimated reproduction number <code>$R_{t}$</code> for
Slovenia, which is shown on Figure 2. The reproduction number has
increased from 3.17 in the beginning (90% CI [2.74&ndash;3.59]) to 3.92
(90% CI [1.56&ndash;9.68]) until the adoption of measures to control the
epidemic, after which the effective <code>$R_{t}$</code> started to decrease reaching
its lowest value of 0.17 (90% CI [0.05&ndash;0.51]) at the end of the study
period. Based on these results it can be concluded that the adopted NPIs
in Slovenia were effective in slowing down the spread of the epidemic
which eventually resulted in the end of the first wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Based on the estimates of the number of infected individuals and
estimated number of deaths, we estimate that throughout the study period
the infection fatality rate (IFR) was 1.56% (90% CI [0.94&ndash;2.21]%)
which at first seems large since <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">other
studies</a> tend to
report it around 0.5%&ndash;1%. This can be explained by noting that during
the first wave of Slovene epidemic, the virus transmitted largely among
older people inside retirement homes who are at much higher risk of
dying due to COVID-19. Up to May 4, around 80% of all deaths occurred
among people from <a href="https://www.dnevnik.si/1042928747">retirement homes</a>
and all deaths outside the hospitals were in retirement homes. Excluding
the estimated number of deaths occurring outside the hospitals yields a
much smaller IFR of 0.80% (90% CI [0.48&ndash;1.26]%) thus more closely
agreeing with other studies. It is of importance therefore to prevent
the spread of the virus among the elderly.</p>
<p>Based on the proposed model we have also estimated the proportion of
cumulatively infected people (i.e. the so-called attack rate) of 0.350%
(90% credible interval (CI): [0.245&ndash;0.573]%) of the Slovene
population suggesting that Slovenia had one of the smallest attack rates
in Europe. It is also estimated that throughout the study period the
proportion of unidentified cases, which can account for asymptomatic
cases, was equal to 88% (90% CI [83-93]%). Unidentified cases can to
some extent be attributed to asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases but
could also reflect the testing strategy of a country. Asymptomatic cases
can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.2565">transmit the virus</a> causing
difficulties in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0965-6">control of the
epidemic</a>. Other studies have
estimated that 40% to 45% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 <a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/M20-3012">remain
asymptomatic</a> with large differences
between the studies (from
<a href="https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180">17.9%</a> to
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.20059618">87.9%</a>). A large estimate
for Slovenia might be a consequence of the fact that people with mild
symptoms during the first wave were instructed to self-isolate and were
in large majority not tested for SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>We can thus conclude that the proposed methodology can give us many
measures that we are interested in when analyzing the development of the
COVID-19 epidemic. The proposed framework is flexible and can be further
extended to more data sources (if available) or other countries/regions
(thus allowing for comparison between them). Additionally, with the
predictions given for the number of patients in hospitals and intensive
care units, policymakers could make data-driven decisions to potentially
avoid overloading the capacities of the healthcare system.</p>
<p>Although in this report we have focused on an earlier study period (up
to June 3, 2020), estimates (and forecasts) for Slovenia have been
provided for later times and they are still daily updated and shown on
the following <a href="https://oblak8.mf.uni-lj.si/covid19/">link</a>. As a strong
second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected throughout Europe in
autumn 2020, we believe that the proposed methodology can be used for
monitoring the pandemic. New epidemiological findings for COVID-19 are
still arriving and some of them have yet to be included in the model.
Thus, further improvements are still possible and we would like to
examine them in the near future.</p>
