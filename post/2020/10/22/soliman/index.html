<main>
<p>As per the records of the World Health Organization, the first formally
reported incidence of Zika virus occurred in Brazil in May 2015. The
disease then rapidly spread to other countries in Americas and East
Asia, affecting more than 1,000,000 people. Zika virus is primarily
transmitted through bites of infected mosquitoes of the species Aedes
(<em>Aedes aegypti</em> and <em>Aedes albopictus</em>). The abundance of mosquitoes
and, as a result, the prevalence of Zika virus infections are common in
areas which have high precipitation, high temperature, and high
population density.</p>

<p>Nonlinear spatio-temporal dependency of such data and lack of historical
public health records make prediction of the virus spread particularly
challenging. We enhance Zika forecasting by introducing the concepts of
topological data analysis and, specifically, persistent homology of
atmospheric variables, into the virus spread modeling. The key rationale
is that topological summaries allow for capturing higher-order
dependencies among atmospheric variables that otherwise might be
unassessable via conventional spatio-temporal modelling approaches based
on geographical proximity assessed via Euclidean distance.</p>

scales <code>$\epsilon$</code>.</p>
<p>Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rapidly emerging methodology at the
interface of computational topology, statistics, and machine learning
which allows for a systematic multi-lens assessment of the underlying
topology and geometry of the data generating process (Zomorodian et al.
2005, Carlsson 2009, Chazal et al. 2017).</p>
<p>We primarily employ tools of persistent homology (PH) within the TDA
framework. The ultimate idea of PH is to quantify dynamics of
topological properties exhibited by the data that live in Euclidean or
abstract metric space, at various resolution scales.</p>
<p>The PH approach is implemented in the two key steps: first, the
underlying hidden topology of the observed data set is approximated
using certain combinatorial objects, e.g., simplicial complexes, and
then the evolution of these combinatorial objects is studied as the
resolution scale varies.</p>
<p>One of the most widely used choices for a simplicial complex within the
TDA framework is a Vietoris--Rips complex which has gained its
popularity due to its computational properties and tractability. An
illustration of the Vietoris--Rips filtration process based on a toy
example of six points as shown in Figure 2. The filtration starts with a
ball of radius 0 (<code>$\epsilon=0$</code>) around each point. As the scale
<code>$\epsilon$</code> increases to 0.2, 0.5, and 1 the number of connected
components decreases and new topological features, such as the loop,
appear.</p>
<p>We introduce a new concept of cumulative Betti numbers and then
integrate the cumulative Betti numbers as topological descriptors into
three predictive machine learning models: random forest, generalized
boosted regression, and deep neural network. Furthermore, to better
quantify for various sources of uncertainties, we combine the resulting
individual model forecasts into an ensemble of the Zika spread
predictions using Bayesian model averaging. The proposed methodology is
illustrated in application to forecasting of the Zika space-time spread
in Brazil in the year 2018. The following Table 1 summarize our
findings.</p>
<p>Table 1 Performance summary for out-of-sample forecasts in terms of MSE,
MAE and Welch&rsquo;s t-test p-values constructed for MSEs and MAEs of the
models with and without topological features</p>
<p><img src="./media/image3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Table 1 indicates that topological features lead to a highly
statistically significant predictive gain, while incorporated into the
DL DFFN model. However, while topological features result in lower
predictive RMSEs for random forest and boosted regression, the
predictive gains evaluated using Welch&rsquo;s <code>$t$</code>-test, appear to be not
significant.</p>
<p>In the future we plan to advance the proposed topological approach to
analysis of other related climate-sensitive diseases such as chikungunya
and dengue, not only in Brazil, but also in other countries.
Furthermore, epidemiological forecasting can benefit from using the
tools of topological data analysis for understanding the spread of
diseases through examination of the joint dynamics of topological
summaries of the disease rates and associated environmental and
socio-economic factors.</p>
