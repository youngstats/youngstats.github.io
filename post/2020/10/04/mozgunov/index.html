<h2 id="1introduction-selecting-best-treatment"><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>Introduction: Selecting Best Treatment</h2>
<p>The question of selecting the &ldquo;best&rdquo; amongst different choices is a
common problem in our lives. In clinical trials, our main field
research, the question usually translates to &ldquo;Out of a number of
alternative treatments, which one treats the patients best?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A traditional approach to answer this question is to randomise equal
numbers of patients to new treatments and the current method of
treatment used in practice, called standard of care (SoC). Subsequently
you compare the groups when the outcome for all patients is known. This
is known as <strong>Equal Allocation</strong>, depicted in Figure 1 (A), and results
in a high accuracy, meaning that if there is truly a difference between
treatments, there is a high chance to find it.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020/10/04/mozgunov/fig1final.png" alt="">
<em>Figure 1: Illustration of (A) Fixed Equal Allocation with all patients being
allocated at the trial start, (B) Adaptive Trial with patients enrolled
in stages with the Blue Treatment being selected at the 2nd
interim.</em></p>
<p>However, since there typically is only one best treatment, many patients
in such trials would be assigned to sub-optimal treatments.</p>
<p>Can we do better than that and offer more benefit to the patients
participating in trials?</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to look at data as they accumulate and adapt
whether which treatments should continue further in the trial. For
example, if a treatment is found to be worse than the current SoC it
would be stopped. Such studies are known as <strong>Adaptive Trials</strong>,
depicted in Figure 1 (B). However, even if ineffective treatments are
dropped earlier, the patient will usually have the same chance of
receiving any of the remaining treatments. Essentially, this is due to
the assumption that new information about each treatment is equally
valuable to us. This, however, might not be the case in many situations
as we are typically more interested in better performing treatments.</p>
<h2 id="new-criterion-to-select-treatments">New Criterion to Select Treatments</h2>
<p>The amount of uncertainty about a treatment is usually measured by an
information measure, among which the Fisher Information and Shannon&rsquo;s
entropy are the most famous in Statistics. These measures do not depend
on the value of the outcomes themselves, or simply, on the context of
these outcomes.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;context&rdquo; of the trial can be included into the information measures
directly using a weight function that gives more value to the points of
specific interest and, essentially, reflects that <strong>information about
treatments which are more effective is more valuable.</strong></p>
<p>In our recent work, we have proposed to use the difference of the
standard and weighted (Shannon) information measures (also known as the
information gain) as a criterion to drive treatment selection in
<strong>Response-Adaptive Trials</strong>, depicted in Figure 2.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020/10/04/mozgunov/fig2final.png" alt="">
<em>Figure 2: Illustration of Response-Adaptive Design with more patients receiving
a better Blue Treatment after the 1st interim, and the Blue Treatment
being selected at the 2nd interim.</em></p>
<p>The new criterion</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>leads to collecting more information about more effective treatments
and hence results in <strong>more ethical allocation</strong> of patients
(compared to the Equal Allocation);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>accounts for the uncertainty around treatments and <strong>allows for a
reliable comparison</strong> between the selected treatment and standard of
care.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-of-potential-benefit" class="unnumbered">Example of Potential Benefit</h2>
<p>To demonstrate the benefit from our proposal, consider a hypothetical
clinical trial. Assume that there are 3 new treatments, A, B, and C to
be compared against the SoC in a trial of 423 patients enrolled one
after the other. Assume that 30% of patients respond given treatments A
and B and SoC, and 50% of patients respond given treatment C. We would
like</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>to have sufficient information to claim that treatment C is indeed
the best;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to assign as many patients to treatment C as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These two goals are competing against each other as patients need to be
assigned to other treatments to make sure C is best, but the new
approach allows to balance these goals. Under a specific choice, our
proposed criterion for the treatment $j$ is
$$\Delta_j = \frac{\left(\hat{p}_j-1 \right)^2}{2 \hat{p}_j (1-\hat{p}_j)} \times n_j^{0.3}$$
which characterises how far the fraction of recovered patients given
treatment $j$, $\hat{p}_j,$ is from the best possible probability of
recovery, $p=1$, (numerator), taking into account the uncertainty around
this estimate (denominator), and the number of patients, $n_j$, assigned
to this treatment (multiplicator). The criterion is updated after the
outcome for previous patient is known.</p>
<p>The first goal will be measured via the chance to reliably claim that
treatment C is better than SoC while the second goal is measured by the
average number of patients that have responded.</p>
<p>We compare two approaches on how such trial can be conducted</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Randomising patients equally to A, B, C and SoC with probability 1/4
each;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Randomising patients proportionally to the new criterion $\Delta_j$;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/post/2020/10/04/mozgunov/figure-new.png" alt="Chance to find that the the best treatment C is indeed better than theSoC, and the average number of patients responded under each of theapproaches."></p>
<p>From FigureÂ 3 we can see that the Equal Randomisation approach results
in just over 80% chance of reliably claiming that the treatment C is
indeed better than SoC while our proposed approach results in nearly 90%
due to more patients being assigned to the best treatment - so a more
reliable conclusion can be made.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the Equal Allocation, the average number of patients
who have responded in the trial is smaller. An additional 18 patients
would have responded if the new randomised approach is used.</p>
<p>Overall, the new approach can be more ethical as it results in more
patients benefiting from participating in the trial while not
compromising the chances of finding the difference between the
treatments.</p>
<p>While clinical trials have been the main motivation for this research,
the design can be applied to a wide range of problems of similar nature,
for example, online advertising, portfolio design, queuing and
communication networks, etc.</p>
