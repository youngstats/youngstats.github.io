<p><em>Vector-borne diseases have long presented major challenges to the health of rural communities in
the wet tropical regions of the world, but especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In this paper, we describe
the contribution that statistical modelling has made to the global elimination programme for one
vector-borne disease, onchocerciasis.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps more than anything else I have written, this paper captures my
career journey from stochastic process theory to tropical disease
epidemiology.</p>
<p>In 1972 I started working towards a PhD in the then-new field of spatial
statistics, and fully expected to write a thesis on stochastic process
models. Instead, I spent most of the next 12 years teaching statistics
at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, but my development as a
researcher was driven by two periods of sabbatical leave. The first,
with the Swedish Royal College of Forestry, gave me my first experience
of field-work, teaching me that a data-set is much more than a set of
numbers. The second, with the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), introduced me to a way of
working as a statistician that I still advocate as the ideal, with joint
affiliation to a group of fellow-statisticians and to a scientific field
that can be both the motivation for and a user of advances in
statistical methodology. I eventually stayed with CSIRO for several
years, collaborating with biologists and environmental scientists,
before a chance meeting with Prof <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/784/scott-l-zeger">Scott Zeger</a>
led me to visit the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, where I
discovered the wonderful world of population health research that has
inspired me for the last 30 years.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Lancaster University in 1988 my methodological
research interests had moved on from spatial statistics to time series
and longitudinal methods, but this was at the time that concerns were
emerging about the adverse health effects of living near
pollution-emitting industries, and spatial statistical methods were
highly relevant to understanding these effects. So I found myself
getting back into spatial statistics, but now in the context of my
new-found passion for population health research.</p>

<p>The final piece in the jigsaw was a visit from a tropical disease
entomologist, Dr <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/madeleine-thomson-04297825/?originalSubdomain=uk">Madeleine Thomson</a>,
who had spotted that spatial statistical methods could help her work in
mapping the prevalence of vector-borne diseases in West Africa. This led
to a series of invitations to contribute to interntional control
programmes for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), a set of diseases
that collectively affect one-sixth of the world&rsquo;s population but, as
implied by their name, have traditionally attracted less attention than
they deserve &ndash; if you want to know more, a good starting point is
<a href="https://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/">https://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/</a>.
Because NTDs principally affect poor countries, understanding their spatial
distribution requires primary data collection that involves painstaking
field-work undertaken with limited resources. This means that you have
to build statistical models that link the field data to remote sensing
data on environmental predictors of disease risk, rather than relying on
non-existent registry data, and you have to analyse the data efficiently
using principled statistical methods.</p>
<p>So, what have I learnt? That stochastic process theory that was
originally developed in a completely different context turns out to be
relevant to public health policy questions many decades later. That
field-work is difficult, and every statistician should try it at least
once. That good statistical practice can add value to almost any area of
scientific inquiry. Most of all, that statisticians benefit from
collaborating with subject-matter experts <strong>and <em>vice versa</em>.</strong></p>
