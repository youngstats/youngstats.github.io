<p><em>As a scientific community, we must understand how scientific
collaboration (SC) works on both the individual and organizational
levels to be able to propose R&amp;D policies that are efficient.
Unfortunately, the interdependent nature of SC among different levels is
often not well considered in empirical studies. To address this issue,
we will present the scientometric approach that provides a simultaneous
insight into SC patterns on both levels: among researchers (individual
level) and organizations (organizational level).</em></p>
<p>The approach is based on the social network methodology that represents
SC with a two-level network (the example is shown in Figure 1). The
nodes on an individual level refer to researchers while nodes on an
organizational level refers to organizations. Researchers are linked if
they wrote a scientific paper together while organizations are linked if
they worked together on a research project. A link between a given
researcher and a given organization exists if the researcher was
employed by this organization.</p>
<p><strong>Figure</strong> <strong>1 Example of a two-level network (left) and the
corresponding blockmodel (right)</strong></p>
<p><img src="/post/2020/10/19/cugmas/image1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By using a blockmodeling approach for such two-level networks, we are
able to identify clusters of researchers and clusters of organizations
that have similar SC patterns (see Figure 1). Experts in social network
analysis would typically
<a href="http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/doc/KN/Course4.pdf">blockmodel</a>
(i.e., search for groups of nodes with a similar pattern of links to
others) each network level separately and then combine the results.
Instead, we used the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.10.006">k-means-based blockmodeling approach for linked
networks</a> (developed by
Aleš Žiberna) that enables the two network levels to be blockmodeled at
once and to thereby examine the interdependencies between the network
levels.</p>
<p>In our study, we focused on SC in the field of social sciences in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia">Slovenia</a> between 2006 and
2015. We obtained data from the national information systems
(<a href="https://www.sicris.si/public/jqm/cris.aspx?lang=eng&amp;opdescr=home">SICRISS</a>
and <a href="https://www.cobiss.si/en/">COBISS</a>) on 788 researchers and their
research papers (3,367 research papers) and corresponding research
organizations (64 distinct organizations).</p>
<p>We applied the mentioned blockmodeling approach to the empirical network
and obtained a network with 15 clusters of researchers and 6 clusters of
organizations. The network of clusters (i.e. blockmodel) is visualized
in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p>
<p>We can see the global network structure of researchers consists of many
internally linked groups of researchers (the loops visualize this).
Meanwhile, the clusters of organizations are not only well-linked
internally, but also with each other. Focusing on the links among groups
of researchers and groups of organizations, only a few links can be seen
among the clusters of researchers who are employed by clusters of
organizations that are otherwise linked. The absence of such links
suggests that SC between organizations is generally not manifested in
publications being written together by researchers from these
organizations, indicating that the formal incentives to encourage SC
between researchers from different organizations might not be seen in SC
on the individual level. Instead, researchers&rsquo; organizational
affiliations strongly determine their SC. Yet, since we can see that the
clusters on both levels are very diverse in terms of scientific
discipline, this means there is still a high level of interdisciplinary
SC.</p>
<p><strong>Figure</strong> <strong>2 The obtained empirical blockmodel with certain
interesting parts identified.</strong> Nodes with a blue-colored border (marked
with the letter R) denote groups of researchers, whereas nodes with a
red-colored border denote groups of organizations (marked with the
letter O). Organizational node sizes are in proportion to the total
number of researchers from organizations belonging to a given cluster.
The size of nodes for individuals is in proportion to the number of
researchers in each cluster. The widths and color-intensity of the edges
within individuals and within organizations are in proportion to the
density of the blocks connecting two given clusters of individuals or
organizations. The widths and color-intensity of the edges between
clusters of individuals and clusters of organizations are arranged so as
to show the share of individuals from a given cluster of individuals who
are affiliated with a given cluster of organizations. The legend shows
the corresponding scientific disciplines.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020/10/19/cugmas/image2.png" alt="">
Now, let us focus on individual parts of the blockmodel that is
obtained:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two clusters (clusters O2 and O6) of organizations with only one
organization in each (i.e., <a href="http://www.ef.uni-lj.si/">School of Economics and Business,
University of Ljubljana</a> and <a href="https://www.fdv.uni-lj.si/studij/oddelki-in-katedre/oddelek-za-sociologijo/katedra-za-druzboslovno-informatiko-in-metodologijo/vsebine-katedre/krizan-sanja">Faculty of
Social Sciences, University of
Ljubljana</a>)
can be identified. While all researchers from the Faculty of Social
Sciences are found in a single cluster, researchers from the School
of Economics and Business are in three distinct clusters that
feature a low level of SC among them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other central organizations in the field of Social sciences in
Slovenia are gathered in a single cluster (O1). Some researchers
from this cluster collaborate with researchers who belong to another
cluster of organizations (cluster O5) from the scientific
disciplines Administrative and organizational sciences, Educational
studies, Sport, and Psychology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cluster of organizations geographically located in the coastal
region of Slovenia or which run research activities in that region
(cluster O3) is also visible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The organizations in the last cluster (cluster O4) are different
faculties and institutes. These organizations are less strongly
linked to each other and the corresponding researchers come from
different scientific disciplines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the above descriptions, we can identify certain factors that
affect SC on the organizational level in Slovenia: the size of
organizations (some organizations with a very high number of researchers
are found in their own clusters), geographical position (e.g.,
particular clusters largely consist of organizations located entirely or
partly in the coastal region of Slovenia), and type (some clusters
consist of organizations whose primary activity is not research).</p>
<p>The main conclusion is that while Slovenian research institutions are
strongly linked through co-participation in projects, these ties are not
strongly reflected as co-authorships among groups of researchers who
come from different institutions.</p>
<p>The results of our analysis are relevant in two respects. On one hand,
they may be seen as an important step in the (methodological) analysis
of the complex social networks that emerge through different forms of SC
in modern science. We are living in times of the tremendous growth of
various types of SC, which is changing the &ldquo;image&rdquo; of modern science. On
the other hand, the results of our analysis are useful for stakeholders
involved in R&amp;D policy (especially in small countries like Slovenia).
The times when R&amp;D policy actors could act without attracting criticism
have passed. Today&rsquo;s R&amp;D policy actors must draw on objective expertise
(even if still rare in practice). Finally, conducting analysis like what
was presented here could also help compensate for the lack of such
objective expertise.</p>
