	abstract = {Summary Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods provide consistent approximations of integrals as the number of iterations goes to ∞. MCMC estimators are generally biased after any fixed number of iterations. We propose to remove this bias by using couplings of Markov chains together with a telescopic sum argument of Glynn and Rhee. The resulting unbiased estimators can be computed independently in parallel. We discuss practical couplings for popular MCMC algorithms. We establish the theoretical validity of the estimators proposed and study their efficiency relative to the underlying MCMC algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the performance and limitations of the method on toy examples, on an Ising model around its critical temperature, on a high dimensional variable-selection problem, and on an approximation of the cut distribution arising in Bayesian inference for models made of multiple modules.},

	abstract = {In this paper many convergence issues concerning the implementation of the Gibbs sampler are investigated. Exact computable rates of convergence for Gaussian target distributions are obtained. Different random and non-random updating strategies and blocking combinations are compared using the rates. The effect of dimensionality and correlation structure on the convergence rates are studied. Some examples are considered to demonstrate the results. For a Gaussian image analysis problem several updating strategies are described and compared. For problems in Bayesian linear models several possible parameterizations are analysed in terms of their convergence rates characterizing the optimal choice.},

	abstract = 	 { Couplings play a central role in the analysis of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms and appear increasingly often in the algorithms themselves, e.g. in convergence diagnostics, parallelization, and variance reduction techniques. Existing couplings of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm handle the proposal and acceptance steps separately and fall short of the upper bound on one-step meeting probabilities given by the coupling inequality. This paper introduces maximal couplings which achieve this bound while retaining the practical advantages of current methods. We consider the properties of these couplings and examine their behavior on a selection of numerical examples. }

We consider a plain Gibbs sampler and propose a simple modification, referred to as a collapsed Gibbs sampler. Under some balancedness conditions on the data designs and assuming that precision hyperparameters are known, we demonstrate that the plain Gibbs sampler is not scalable, in the sense that its complexity is worse than proportional to the number of parameters and data, but the collapsed Gibbs sampler is scalable. In simulated and real datasets we show that the explicit convergence rates predicted by our theory closely match the computable, but nonexplicit rates in cases where the design assumptions are violated. We also show empirically that the collapsed Gibbs sampler extended to sample precision hyperparameters significantly outperforms alternative state-of-the-art algorithms.}",

	abstract = "{We propose a method for parallelization of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo estimators. Our approach involves constructing a pair of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo chains that are coupled in such a way that they meet exactly after some random number of iterations. These chains can then be combined so that the resulting estimators are unbiased. This allows us to produce independent replicates in parallel and average them to obtain estimators that are consistent in the limit of the number of replicates, rather than in the usual limit of the number of Markov chain iterations. We investigate the scalability of our coupling in high dimensions on a toy example. The choice of algorithmic parameters and the efficiency of our proposed approach are then illustrated on a logistic regression with 300 covariates and a log-Gaussian Cox point processes model with low- to fine-grained discretizations.}",

	abstract={Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},
