      <description>IntroductionIn the last decade, there have been spectacular advances on the practical side of machine learning.One of the most impressive may be the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation (Goodfellow et al. 2014).State of the art models are capable of producing portraits of fake persons that look perfectly authentic to you and me (see e.g. (Salimans et al. 2016) and (Karras et al.</description>

      <description>IntroductionLet us start by considering the optimal rejection policy for a single hypothesis testing problem. There are three elements to the problem. The objective: to maximize the power to reject the null hypothesis; The constraint: to control the type I error probability, so that it is at most a predefined \(\alpha\); The decision policy: for every realized sample define the decision \(D\in \{0,1\}\), where the null hypothesis is rejected if \(D=1\) and retained otherwise.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Two-Layer Neural Network via Displacement Convexity</title>

      <description>AbstractWe consider the problem of learning a function defined on a compact domain, using linear combinationsof a large number of “bump-like” components (neurons). This idea lies at the core of a variety of methodsfrom two-layer neural networks to kernel regression, to boosting. In general, the resulting risk minimizationproblem is non-convex and is solved by gradient descent or its variants. Nonetheless, little is known aboutglobal convergence properties of these approaches.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Empirical Bayes Approach to Variable Selection in Generalized Linear Models</title>

      <description>In the toolbox of most scientists over the past century, there have been few methods as powerful and as versatile as linear regression. The introduction of the generalized linear model (GLM) framework in the 1970’s extended the inferential and predictive capabilities to binary or count data. While the effect of this ‘Swiss Army knife’ of scientific research cannot be overstated, rapid (and amazing) technological advances in other areas have pushed it beyond its theoretical capacity.</description>

      <title>Compositional scalar-on-function regression as a tool (not only) for geological data</title>

      <description>Compositional data are characterized by the fact that the relevant information is contained not necessarily in the absolute values but rather in the relative proportions between particular components. As an example, take household expenditures for different purposes (housing, groceries, travel etc.) or geochemical composition of a certain soil sample. In the latter case, the resulting composition of chemical elements is determined strongly by the particle size distribution (PSD, i.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://youngstats.github.io/post/2021/03/10/higher-order-targeted-maximum-likelihood-estimation/</link>

      <guid>https://youngstats.github.io/post/2021/03/10/higher-order-targeted-maximum-likelihood-estimation/</guid>
      <description>Summary
We propose a higher order targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) that only relies on a sequentially and recursively defined set of data-adaptive fluctuations. Without the need to assume the often too stringent higher order pathwise differentiability, the method is practical for implementation and has the potential to be fully computerized.
Background Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) It has been particularly of interest for semiparametric theories and real world practices to make efficient and substitution-based estimation for target quantities that are functions of data distribution.</description>

      <title>Give me an adequate correlation: assessing relationships in percentage (or proportional) data</title>

      <description>Correlations and negative bias We assume that you are quite familiar with the following problem. Consider a data set where the information is expressed in percentages or proportions. An example are household expenditures, given as average amounts (in Euros) the households are spending on food, housing, transportation, etc. Since the expenditures would not be comparable among countries with very different economic level, it makes sense to express the data as proportions (or percentages) of the single categories on the total expenditures.</description>
