      <description>IntroductionAbundant multivariate spatial data from the natural and environmental sciences demands research on the joint distribution of multiple spatially dependent variables (Wackernagel (2013), Cressie and Wikle (2011), Banerjee and Gelfand (2014)). Here, our goal is to estimate associations over spatial locations for each variable and those among the variables.
In this document, we will present an example of a simulated multivariate spatial data and how we can use Graphical Gaussian processes (GGP) (Dey and Banerjee (2021)) to model the data.</description>

      <description>Meanders, monotone meanders, and Baxter permutationsVersions of the following question can be traced back at least to the work of Henri Poincaré (Poincaré (1912)):
In how many ways a simple loop in the plane can cross a line a specified number of times?
Despite many efforts, this question remains open after more than a century.Let us start by mathematically formalizing the latter question.
Definition 1.1. A meander of size \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) is a simple loop \(\ell\) (i.</description>

      <description>OverviewIn many real data applications we are often required to model jointly \(d\geq 3\) continuous random variables, denoted as \(Y_1,\dots,Y_d\) . The multivariate distribution, which allows us to describe the joint behaviour of those variables, can be denoted as \(F(Y_1,\dots,Y_d)=P(Y_1\le y_1,\dots,Y_d,\le y_d)\) . However, complex relations between data, particularly asymmetric and tail dependent associations, are often difficult to be modelled. The copula approach allows us to express the multivariate distribution of a set of variables by separating the marginals from the dependence structure.</description>

      <description>Passive scalar turbulence is the study of how a scalar quantity, such astemperature or salinity, is transported by an incompressible fluid. Thisprocess is modeled by the advection diffusion equation\[\begin{equation}\partial_tg_t + u_t\cdot\nabla g_t - \kappa \Delta g_t = s_t,\label{eqAD}\tag{AD}\end{equation}\] where \(g_t\) is the scalar quantity, \(u_t\) is anincompressible velocity field, \(\kappa&amp;gt;0\) is the diffusivity parameterand \(s_t\) is a replenishing source. As \(g_t\) evolves, it often settlesinto a statistical steady state and complex self-similar structuresarise due to repeated stretching and folding by the velocity field.</description>

      <description>Recent advances in extreme value theory
Thursday, April 20th, 6:00 PT / 9:00 ET / 15:00 CET
Extreme value theory is concerned with the accurate statistical assessment of the risk of rare events. Such extreme events have small occurrence probabilities but often entail large economic and ecological costs in addition to their potential for severe impacts on human health. There is active research to model and infer complex extremal dependence structures in multivariate data, with connections to high-dimensional statistics, machine learning and other fields.</description>

      <description>Rough VolatilityNew insights about the regularity of the instantaneous variance obtainedfrom realized variance data (see Gatheral, Jaisson, and Rosenbaum (2018), Bennedsen, Lunde, and Pakkanen (2021, to appear) and Fukasawa, Takabatake, and Westphal (2019)), have inspiredthe development of so-called rough stochastic volatility modelsin the financial literature. In simple terms, such a model can bedescribed by the following SDE \[\begin{equation}\label{eq:stoch-vol}dS_t = S_t \sqrt{v_t}dB_t,\end{equation}\] where the logarithm of the instantaneous variance process\(v\) behaves similarly to a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurstindex \(0 &amp;lt; H &amp;lt; 1/2\).</description>

      <title>Procrustes Analysis for High-Dimensional Data</title>

      <description>OverviewThe Procrustes problem aims to match matrices using similarity transformations (i.e., rotation, reflection, translation, and scaling transformations) to minimize their Frobenius distance. It allows the comparison of matrices with dimensions defined in an arbitrary coordinate system. This method raised the interest of applied researchers, highlighting its potentiality through many applications in several fields, such as ecology, biology, analytical chemometrics, and psychometrics.
The interest of a large audience from applied fields stimulates, in parallel, the growth of a vast body of literature.</description>

      <description>Exchangeable arrays have been studied since the late 70’s (Aldous (1983),Kallenberg (2005)). Eagleson and Weber (1978) and Silverman (1976) established Strong Law of LargeNumbers and Central Limit Theorems for such arrays. Because non-sparsenetworks and multiway clustering are related to exchangeable arrays,they have received recent attention in statistics and econometrics(Davezies, D’Haultfœuille, and Guyonvarch (2018), Davezies, D’Haultfœuille, and Guyonvarch (2021), Menzel (2018)). We focus below on non-sparse networksand present uniformity results at the basis of the asymptotic normalityof many nonlinear estimators.</description>

      <description>OverviewTraditionally the excitation noise of spatial and temporal models is Gaussian. Take, for instance, an AR1 (autoregressive of order 1) process, where the increments \(x_{i+1}-\rho x_i, \ \ |\rho|&amp;lt;1\) are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. However, it is easy to find datasets that contain inherently non-Gaussian features, such as sudden jumps or spikes, that adversely affect the inferences and predictions made from Gaussian models. In this post, we introduce a specific class of non-Gaussian models, their advantages over Gaussian models, and their Bayesian implementation in Stan and R-INLA, two well-established platforms for statistical modeling.</description>
