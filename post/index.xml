      <description>OverviewSets of graphs arise in many different applications, from medicine tofinance, from urban planning to social science. Analysing sets of graphsis far from trivial as they are strongly non Euclidean data type. Thereare two main sets of graphs:
labelled: where there is the same sets of nodes across eachobservation;unlabelled: where there is no clear correspondence in the nodesacross networks.Unlabelled graphs poses high challenges from both the embeddingprospective (which geometrical embedding is suitable for such graphs)and the statistical perspective (how can we extend basic tools to suchembedding).</description>

      <description>Stochastic Fluid Dynamics
Wednesday, November 15th, 6:00 PT / 9:00 ET / 15:00 CET
The study of fluid dynamics equations with white forcing is a classical topic in SPDEs and ergodic theory. Recently a new wave of interest, with a shift in focus towards transport noise, has risen, due to its connections with Stochastic Geometric Mechanics, Turbulence, Climate Modelling, Stochastic Parametrization and Uncertainty Quantification.
In this webinar, selected young researchers will present their recent works on the topic.</description>

      <description>OverviewIn this post we present a new estimation procedure for functional linearregression useful when the regression surface – or curve – is supposedto be exactly zero within specific regions of its domain. Our approachinvolves regularization techniques, merging a B-spline representation ofthe unknown coefficient function with a peculiar overlap group lassopenalty. The methodology is illustrated on the well-known Swedishmortality dataset and can be employed by \({\tt R}\)users through the package \({\tt fdaSP}\).</description>

      <description>In the following we show how it is possible to obtain parallelizable, unbiased and computationally cheap estimates of Crossed random effects models with a linear cost in the number of datapoints (and paramaters) exploiting couplings.
Crossed random effects models (CREM)CREM model a continuous response variables \(Y\) as depending on the sum of unknown effects of \(K\) categorical predictors. Think of the \(Y_n\) as the ratings given to university courses, along with some factors potentially impacting such a score, e.</description>

      <title>Illustration of Graphical Gaussian Process models to analyze highly multivariate spatial data</title>

      <description>IntroductionAbundant multivariate spatial data from the natural and environmental sciences demands research on the joint distribution of multiple spatially dependent variables (Wackernagel (2013), Cressie and Wikle (2011), Banerjee and Gelfand (2014)). Here, our goal is to estimate associations over spatial locations for each variable and those among the variables.
In this document, we will present an example of a simulated multivariate spatial data and how we can use Graphical Gaussian processes (GGP) (Dey and Banerjee (2021)) to model the data.</description>

      <description>Meanders, monotone meanders, and Baxter permutationsVersions of the following question can be traced back at least to the work of Henri Poincaré (Poincaré (1912)):
In how many ways a simple loop in the plane can cross a line a specified number of times?
Despite many efforts, this question remains open after more than a century.Let us start by mathematically formalizing the latter question.
Definition 1.1. A meander of size \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) is a simple loop \(\ell\) (i.</description>

      <description>OverviewIn many real data applications we are often required to model jointly \(d\geq 3\) continuous random variables, denoted as \(Y_1,\dots,Y_d\) . The multivariate distribution, which allows us to describe the joint behaviour of those variables, can be denoted as \(F(Y_1,\dots,Y_d)=P(Y_1\le y_1,\dots,Y_d,\le y_d)\) . However, complex relations between data, particularly asymmetric and tail dependent associations, are often difficult to be modelled. The copula approach allows us to express the multivariate distribution of a set of variables by separating the marginals from the dependence structure.</description>

      <description>Passive scalar turbulence is the study of how a scalar quantity, such astemperature or salinity, is transported by an incompressible fluid. Thisprocess is modeled by the advection diffusion equation\[\begin{equation}\partial_tg_t + u_t\cdot\nabla g_t - \kappa \Delta g_t = s_t,\label{eqAD}\tag{AD}\end{equation}\] where \(g_t\) is the scalar quantity, \(u_t\) is anincompressible velocity field, \(\kappa&amp;gt;0\) is the diffusivity parameterand \(s_t\) is a replenishing source. As \(g_t\) evolves, it often settlesinto a statistical steady state and complex self-similar structuresarise due to repeated stretching and folding by the velocity field.</description>

      <description>Recent advances in extreme value theory
Thursday, April 20th, 6:00 PT / 9:00 ET / 15:00 CET
Extreme value theory is concerned with the accurate statistical assessment of the risk of rare events. Such extreme events have small occurrence probabilities but often entail large economic and ecological costs in addition to their potential for severe impacts on human health. There is active research to model and infer complex extremal dependence structures in multivariate data, with connections to high-dimensional statistics, machine learning and other fields.</description>
