      <description>Correlations and negative bias We assume that you are quite familiar with the following problem. Consider a data set where the information is expressed in percentages or proportions. An example are household expenditures, given as average amounts (in Euros) the households are spending on food, housing, transportation, etc. Since the expenditures would not be comparable among countries with very different economic level, it makes sense to express the data as proportions (or percentages) of the single categories on the total expenditures.</description>

      <title>Locally adapative k-nearest neighbour classification</title>

      <description>Abstract Binary classification is one of the cornerstones of modern data science, but, until recently, our understanding of classical methods such as the k-nn algorithm was limited to settings where feature vectors were compactly supported. Based on a new analysis of this classifier, we propose a variant with significantly lower risk for heavy-tailed distributions.
 The \(k\)-nearest neighbour classifier The basic classifier that we consider here was introduced by Fix and Hodges (1951), and is arguably the simplest and most intuitive nonparametric classifier.</description>

      <title>PLS for Big Data: A unified parallel algorithm for regularised group PLS</title>

      <description>We look at the problem of learning latent structure between two blocks of data through the partial least squares (PLS) approach. These methods include approaches for supervised and unsupervised statistical learning. We review these methods and present approaches to decrease the computation time and scale the method to big data
Given two blocks of data, the PLS approach seeks latent variables which are constructed as linear combinations of the original datasets.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for causal inference that works</title>

      <description>I’ve kindly been invited to share a few words about a recent paper my colleagues and I published in Bayesian Analysis: “Bayesian Regression Tree Models for Causal Inference: Regularization, Confounding, and Heterogeneous Effects”. In that paper, we motivate and describe a method that we call Bayesian causal forests (BCF), which is now implemented in an R package called bcf.
The goal of this post is to work through a simple toy example to illustrate the strengths of BCF.</description>

      <description>body { text-align: justify}  Abstract Co-clustering techniques, which group observations and features simultaneously, have proven to be efficient in summarising data sets. They exploit the dualism between rows and columns and the data set is summarized in blocks (the crossing of a row-cluster and a column-cluster). However, in the case of mixed data sets (with features of different kind), it is not easy to define a co-clustering method that takes this heterogeneity into account.</description>

      <description>We address the problem of causal structure learning in the presence of hidden variables. Given a target variable and a vector of covariates, we are trying to infer the set of observable causal parents of the target variable. There are many good reasons for being interested in causal predictors.
Given a target variable $Y$, and a vector $X = (X^1, \dots, X^d)$ of $d$ covariates, we are trying to infer the set $S^* \subseteq \{1, \dots, d\}$ of observable causal parents of $Y$.</description>

      <title>Functional Regression Control Chart: a New Framework for Profile Monitoring

      <description>Introduction New statistical process control (SPC) methods have to be developed in order to handle more and more complex data, which are available because of the advent of new data acquisition technologies. In particular, in many practical situations the quality characteristic of a process can be modelled as a function defined on a compact domain, data of such kind are the foundation of a rapidly expanding area of statistics referred to as functional data analysis (FDA).</description>

      <title>Online cash register data in the measurement of retail trade turnover</title>

      <description>The Hungarian Central Statistical Office uses online cash register data for the measurement of retail trade and food services. The data source allows the statistical office to considerably cut administrative burden of data providers without quality loss in retail trade statistics. Online cash register data is widely used in tracking the latest developments in retail trade during the coronavirus pandemic as well.
Online cash registers (online pénztárgép &amp;ndash; OPG) were introduced in Hungary in 2013.</description>

      <title>Making an Online Risk Calculator</title>

      <description>We first started making risk calculators with the website, http://nomograms.org. There are several here, and they are patient friendly. Later, we launched rcalc.ccf.org, which has many more risk calculators, although the intended audience is the clinician. It is considerably more expensive and time-consuming to make these patient friendly. There were many obstacles to overcome in making these websites. Here is an example (Figure 1), from prostate cancer research where our calculator assists with an optional treatment by showing the 4-year risks of several outcomes for both options:</description>
