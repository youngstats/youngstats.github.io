      <description>AbstractThe mixture cure model in survival analysis has received large and growing attention in the last few decades. Here we present an overview drawing together early results and some recent new developments, and pointing out areas where further work is needed.
Introduction: the Mixture Cure ModelIn certain clinical trials or observational studies, either prospective or based on historically accumulated data, individuals are or have been followed up for a period of time and their status at some endpoint reported.</description>

      <description>Complex systems are difficult to understand. We need good tools to study the interactions that define such systems. In this blog post, we describe how the framework in Mogensen and Hansen (2022) provides such a tool. This summary of the paper is meant to be accessible for readers with some background in statistics or other quantitative sciences. We couldn’t help but include some more specific comments intended for those readers that are familiar with graphical models in statistics.</description>

      <title>Inference on Adaptively Collected Data</title>

      <description>AbstractIt is increasingly common for data to be collected adaptively, whereexperimental costs are reduced progressively by assigning promisingtreatments more frequently. However, adaptivity also poses greatchallenges on post-experiment inference, since observations aredependent, and standard estimates can be skewed and heavy-tailed. Wepropose a treatment-effect estimator that is consistent andasymptotically normal, allowing for constructing frequentist confidenceintervals and testing hypotheses.
IntroductionAdaptive data collection can optimize sample efficiency during thecourse of the experiment for particular objectives, such as identifyingthe best treatment (D.</description>

      <description>Nonparametric inference based on statistical depth
Monday, October 17th, 7:00 PT / 10:00 ET / 16:00 CET
The notion of center of an object, be it a set of observations, a physical object or a random variable, is difficult to define. This motivated the development of general ways to measure centrality via depth functions. Such mappings allow for comparing relative centrality of two locations and, consequently, providing a center-outward ordering.</description>

      <description>Recent challenges in model specification testing based on differentdata structures
Wednesday, November 9th, 8:00 PT / 11:00 ET / 17:00 CET
Model specification testing is one of the essential methodological tasksin statistics. Recently, with the development of different datastructures, envisioning concepts from classical data setups to otherenvironments becomes very important.
In the webinar, selected young statisticians will present their recentworks and elaborate on different aspects of this topic.</description>

      <title>Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process Intensity Modeling and Estimation using Measure Transport</title>

      <description>IntroductionA NHPP defined on \({\cal S} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\) can be fullycharacterized through its intensity function \(\lambda: {\cal S} \rightarrow [0, \infty)\).We present a general model for the intensity function of a non-homogeneous Poissonprocess using measure transport. The model finds its roots in transportation ofprobability measure (Marzouk et al. 2016), an approach that has gainedpopularity recently for its ability to model arbitrary probabilitydensity functions.</description>

      <title>Macroeconomic Determinants of Migration. A Comparative Analysis For Old vs New European Member States</title>

      <description>Introduction
Migration is a multifaceted phenomenon including macro-, meso-, andmicro-triggers that, when combined, decide an individual’s finaldecision to migrate. Apart from being an essential component ofpopulation change, migration is also an important component ofpopulation estimates and labor market force estimations. Jennissen(2004) argues that the presence of migrant populations has a favorableimpact on natural population growth since migrants’ age characteristicsand fertility rates are often greater than those of the indigenouspopulation.</description>

      <description>We briefly review the two classical problems of distribution estimationand identity testing (in the context of property testing), then proposeto extend them to a Markovian setting. We will see that the samplecomplexity depends not only on the number of states, but also on thestationary and mixing properties of the chains.
The distribution settingEstimation/Learning. A fundamental problem in statistics is toestimate a probability distribution from independent samples.</description>

      <description>Regularization by Noise for Stochastic Differential and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations
The regularizing effects of noisy perturbations of differential equations is a central subject of stochastic analysis. Recent breakthroughs initiated a new wave of interest, particularly concerning non-Markovian, infinite dimensional, and rough-stochastic / Young-stochastic hybrid systems.
On the webinar, selected younger scholars will present their recent works on the topic.

      <description>Theory and Methods for Inference in Multi-armed Bandit Problems
Multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms have been argued for decades as useful to conduct adaptively-randomized experiments. By skewing the allocation of the arms towards the more efficient or informative ones, they have the potential to enhance participants’ welfare, while resulting in a more flexible, efficient, and ethical alternative compared to traditional fixed studies. However, such allocation strategies complicate the problem of statistical inference.</description>
