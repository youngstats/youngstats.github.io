      <description>Introduction&#xD;The Lévy distribution, together with the Normal and Cauchy distribution,&#xD;belongs to the class of stable distributions, and it is among the only&#xD;three distributions for which the density can be derived in a closed&#xD;form. The density function of the two-parameter Lévy distribution is&#xD;expressed as follows: \[\begin{equation*}&#xD;f(x; \lambda, \mu)=\sqrt{\dfrac{ \lambda}{2\pi}}\frac{e^{-\dfrac{ \lambda}{2(x-\mu)}}}{(x-\mu)^{\frac{3}{2}}},\;x\geq\mu,\; \lambda&amp;gt;0, \; \mu\in \mathbb{R}.&#xD;\end{equation*}\] We specifically consider the scenario where \(\mu=0\) due&#xD;to the difficulty in estimating both parameters.</description>

      <description>Background&#xD;Circular data, i.e., data defined on the unit circle, can be found in many areas of science.&#xD;The unique nature of these data means that conventional methods for non-circular data are not valid for these.&#xD;At the same time, advances in geographical information and global positioning systems have generated large amounts of spatial data and, consequently, have increased the need for spatial models that accurately describe it.&#xD;An example of circular, spatial data are the average wind directions in Germany from April 1 to 10, 2019, plotted in space (left) and on a circular histogram (right):</description>

      <description>Overview&#xD;Sets of graphs arise in many different applications, from medicine to&#xD;finance, from urban planning to social science. Analysing sets of graphs&#xD;is far from trivial as they are strongly non Euclidean data type. There&#xD;are two main sets of graphs:&#xA;labelled: where there is the same sets of nodes across each&#xD;observation;&#xD;unlabelled: where there is no clear correspondence in the nodes&#xD;across networks.&#xD;Unlabelled graphs poses high challenges from both the embedding&#xD;prospective (which geometrical embedding is suitable for such graphs)&#xD;and the statistical perspective (how can we extend basic tools to such&#xD;embedding).</description>

      <description>Stochastic Fluid Dynamics&#xA;Wednesday, November 15th, 6:00 PT / 9:00 ET / 15:00 CET&#xA;The study of fluid dynamics equations with white forcing is a classical topic in SPDEs and ergodic theory. Recently a new wave of interest, with a shift in focus towards transport noise, has risen, due to its connections with Stochastic Geometric Mechanics, Turbulence, Climate Modelling, Stochastic Parametrization and Uncertainty Quantification.&#xA;In this webinar, selected young researchers will present their recent works on the topic.</description>

      <title>Locally Sparse Functional Regression</title>
      <link>https://youngstats.github.io/post/2023/10/09/locally-sparse-functional-regression/</link>

      <guid>https://youngstats.github.io/post/2023/10/09/locally-sparse-functional-regression/</guid>
      <description>Overview&#xD;In this post we present a new estimation procedure for functional linear&#xD;regression useful when the regression surface – or curve – is supposed&#xD;to be exactly zero within specific regions of its domain. Our approach&#xD;involves regularization techniques, merging a B-spline representation of&#xD;the unknown coefficient function with a peculiar overlap group lasso&#xD;penalty. The methodology is illustrated on the well-known Swedish&#xD;mortality dataset and can be employed by \({\tt R}\)&#xD;users through the package \({\tt fdaSP}\).</description>

      <title>Linear-cost unbiased estimator for large crossed random effect models via couplings</title>

      <description>In the following we show how it is possible to obtain parallelizable, unbiased and computationally cheap estimates of Crossed random effects models with a linear cost in the number of datapoints (and paramaters) exploiting couplings.&#xA;Crossed random effects models (CREM)&#xD;CREM model a continuous response variables \(Y\) as depending on the sum of unknown effects of \(K\) categorical predictors. Think of the \(Y_n\) as the ratings given to university courses, along with some factors potentially impacting such a score, e.</description>

      <description>Introduction&#xD;Abundant multivariate spatial data from the natural and environmental sciences demands research on the joint distribution of multiple spatially dependent variables (Wackernagel (2013), Cressie and Wikle (2011), Banerjee and Gelfand (2014)). Here, our goal is to estimate associations over spatial locations for each variable and those among the variables.&#xA;In this document, we will present an example of a simulated multivariate spatial data and how we can use Graphical Gaussian processes (GGP) (Dey and Banerjee (2021)) to model the data.</description>
