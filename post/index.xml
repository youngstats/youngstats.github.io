      <description>AbstractIt is increasingly common for data to be collected adaptively, whereexperimental costs are reduced progressively by assigning promisingtreatments more frequently. However, adaptivity also poses greatchallenges on post-experiment inference, since observations aredependent, and standard estimates can be skewed and heavy-tailed. Wepropose a treatment-effect estimator that is consistent andasymptotically normal, allowing for constructing frequentist confidenceintervals and testing hypotheses.
IntroductionAdaptive data collection can optimize sample efficiency during thecourse of the experiment for particular objectives, such as identifyingthe best treatment (D.</description>

      <description>Nonparametric inference based on statistical depth
Monday, October 17th, 7:00 PT / 10:00 ET / 16:00 CET
The notion of center of an object, be it a set of observations, a physical object or a random variable, is difficult to define. This motivated the development of general ways to measure centrality via depth functions. Such mappings allow for comparing relative centrality of two locations and, consequently, providing a center-outward ordering.</description>

      <description>Recent challenges in model specification testing based on differentdata structures
Wednesday, November 9th, 8:00 PT / 11:00 ET / 17:00 CET
Model specification testing is one of the essential methodological tasksin statistics. Recently, with the development of different datastructures, envisioning concepts from classical data setups to otherenvironments becomes very important.
In the webinar, selected young statisticians will present their recentworks and elaborate on different aspects of this topic.</description>

      <title>Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process Intensity Modeling and Estimation using Measure Transport</title>

      <description>IntroductionA NHPP defined on \({\cal S} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\) can be fullycharacterized through its intensity function \(\lambda: {\cal S} \rightarrow [0, \infty)\).We present a general model for the intensity function of a non-homogeneous Poissonprocess using measure transport. The model finds its roots in transportation ofprobability measure (Marzouk et al. 2016), an approach that has gainedpopularity recently for its ability to model arbitrary probabilitydensity functions.</description>

      <title>Macroeconomic Determinants of Migration. A Comparative Analysis For Old vs New European Member States</title>

      <description>Introduction
Migration is a multifaceted phenomenon including macro-, meso-, andmicro-triggers that, when combined, decide an individual’s finaldecision to migrate. Apart from being an essential component ofpopulation change, migration is also an important component ofpopulation estimates and labor market force estimations. Jennissen(2004) argues that the presence of migrant populations has a favorableimpact on natural population growth since migrants’ age characteristicsand fertility rates are often greater than those of the indigenouspopulation.</description>

      <description>We briefly review the two classical problems of distribution estimationand identity testing (in the context of property testing), then proposeto extend them to a Markovian setting. We will see that the samplecomplexity depends not only on the number of states, but also on thestationary and mixing properties of the chains.
The distribution settingEstimation/Learning. A fundamental problem in statistics is toestimate a probability distribution from independent samples.</description>

      <description>Regularization by Noise for Stochastic Differential and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations
The regularizing effects of noisy perturbations of differential equations is a central subject of stochastic analysis. Recent breakthroughs initiated a new wave of interest, particularly concerning non-Markovian, infinite dimensional, and rough-stochastic / Young-stochastic hybrid systems.
On the webinar, selected younger scholars will present their recent works on the topic.

      <description>Theory and Methods for Inference in Multi-armed Bandit Problems
Multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms have been argued for decades as useful to conduct adaptively-randomized experiments. By skewing the allocation of the arms towards the more efficient or informative ones, they have the potential to enhance participants’ welfare, while resulting in a more flexible, efficient, and ethical alternative compared to traditional fixed studies. However, such allocation strategies complicate the problem of statistical inference.</description>

      <description>Selection of Priors in Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling
Structural equation modeling (SEM) is an important framework within the social sciences that encompasses a wide variety of statistical models. Traditionally, estimation of SEMs has relied on maximum likelihood. Unfortunately, there also exist a variety of situations in which maximum likelihood performs subpar. This led researchers to turn to alternative estimation methods, in particular, Bayesian estimation of SEMs or BSEM. However, it is currently unclear how to specify the prior distribution in order to attain the advantages of Bayesian approaches.</description>

      <description>Recent Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference
In approximate Bayesian computation, likelihood function is intractable and needs to be itself estimated using forward simulations of the statistical model (Beaumont et al., 2002; Marin et al., 2012; Sisson et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2020). Recent years have seen numerous advances in approximate inference methods, which have enabled Bayesian inference in increasingly challenging scenarios involving complex probabilistic models and large datasets.</description>
