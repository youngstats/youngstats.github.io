  journal =	 {CoRR},
  year =	 2015,
  abstract =	 {We propose a new algorithmic framework for
                  sequential hypothesis testing with i.i.d. data,
                  which includes A/B testing, nonparametric two-sample
                  testing, and independence testing as special
                  cases. It is novel in several ways: (a) it takes
                  linear time and constant space to compute on the
                  fly, (b) it has the same power guarantee as a
                  non-sequential version of the test with the same
                  computational constraints up to a small factor, and
                  (c) it accesses only as many samples as are required
                  - its stopping time adapts to the unknown difficulty
                  of the problem. All our test statistics are
                  constructed to be zero-mean martingales under the
                  null hypothesis, and the rejection threshold is
                  governed by a uniform non-asymptotic law of the
                  iterated logarithm (LIL). For the case of
                  nonparametric two-sample mean testing, we also
                  provide a finite sample power analysis, and the
                  first non-asymptotic stopping time calculations for
                  this class of problems. We verify our predictions
                  for type I and II errors and stopping times using

                  optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural
                  networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust
                  performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning
                  simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking
                  gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the
                  screen as input. Despite its approximations that
                  deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give
                  monotonic improvement, with little tuning of
                  hyperparameters.},
