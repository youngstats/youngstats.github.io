<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In the past decades, intelligent transportation system (ITS) has brought advanced technology that enables a data-rich environment and unprecedented opportunities for traffic prediction, which is considered as one of the most prevalent issues facing ITS (Li et al., 2015). We discuss the online prediction of the origin-destination (OD) demand count in traffic networks, which represents the number of trips between certain combinations of an origin and a destination. The study of OD demand prediction based on count data has a growing impact on many traffic control and management policies (Ashok, 1996, Ashok and Ben-Akiva, 2002, Li, 2005, Hazelton, 2008, Shao et al., 2014). For example, dynamic OD demand prediction is critical in planning for the charging services of the electrical vehicles (EV; Zhang et al., 2017). A well-designed charging facility network is necessary to extend the vehicle range and popularize the use of EVs. In particular, the dynamic demand between nodes of the traffic network plays a key role in determining the availability of the charging facilities, planning the multi-period charging schedules, and meeting the customer needs at the maximum extent (Zhang et al., 2017, Brandstatter et al., 2017). The objective of this study is to appropriately model the stochastic OD traffic demand counts considering the spatiotemporal correlations between different routes and epochs, while incorporating physical knowledge of the traffic network in the estimation. The estimation results are expected to enhance the prediction accuracy and robustness of the online traffic demand prediction for future epochs.</p>
<p><strong>Model and method</strong></p>
<p>We investigate a multivariate Poisson log-normal model with a
block-diagonal covariance matrix and incorporate domain knowledge of the
traffic network features to account for spatial correlations. Let
<span class="math inline">\(N_{\text{ijt}}\)</span> denote the observed traffic demand (i.e., the count of
vehicles) for route <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> on day <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, at epoch <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Based on the natural
characteristics of the demand counts, it is reasonable to model each
observation <span class="math inline">\(N_{\text{ijt}}\)</span> with a Poisson log-linear model (Perrakis
et al., 2014, Xian et al. 2018) such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[N_{\text{ijt}}\sim\text{Poisson}\left( \lambda_{\text{ijt}} \right),u_{\text{ijt}} = \log\lambda_{\text{ijt}}.\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{\text{ijt}}\)</span> is the intensity of the Poisson process, and
<span class="math inline">\(u_{\text{ijt}}\)</span> is the log transformation of the intensity. To
characterize the spatiotemporal correlations across different routes and
time points, we model <span class="math inline">\(u_{\text{ijt}}\)</span> as a mixed-effect Gaussian
process based on <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> basis functions <span class="math inline">\(B_{k}(t)\)</span> that</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math display">\[u_{\text{ijt}} = \mu_{\text{jt}} + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}{\gamma_{\text{jk}}B_{k}(t)} + Z_{\text{ijt}}.\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\mu =}\left\lbrack \mu_{11},\mu_{12},\ \cdots,\ \mu_{\text{JT}} \right\rbrack\mathbf{&#39;}\)</span>
is the fixed effect coefficient that models the common characteristics
of the whole traffic network, and
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\gamma}_{k}\mathbf{=}\left\lbrack \gamma_{1k},\ \gamma_{2k},\ \cdots,\ \gamma_{\text{Jk}} \right\rbrack\)</span>
is the random effect coefficient with prior distribution
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\gamma}_{k}\sim N(0,\ \mathbf{R}_{\theta_{y}})\)</span> that
characterizes the uniqueness of different routes. Here
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}_{\theta_{y}}\)</span> is the correlation matrix which takes into
consideration of the traffic network information, where
<span class="math inline">\(\left\lbrack \mathbf{R}_{\theta_{y}} \right\rbrack_{j_{1},j_{2}} = \sigma_{j_{1},\ j_{2}}\exp\left\{ - \theta_{y}\left| \mathbf{y}_{j_{1}} - \mathbf{y}_{j_{2}} \right|^{2} \right\}\)</span>.
In this expression, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{y}_{j}\)</span> denotes the unique features of
route <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, such as information about the origin and destination, the
maximum speed limit on a route, and the travel distance. The term
<span class="math inline">\(Z_{\text{ijt}}\)</span> in model (1) is the random error that follows a
Gaussian distribution which has the covariance structure</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math display">\[\text{cov}\left( Z_{ij_{1}t_{1}},Z_{ij_{2}t_{2}} \right) = \sigma_{j_{1},\ j_{2}}\exp\left\{ - \theta_{y}\left| \mathbf{y}_{j_{1}} - \mathbf{y}_{j_{2}} \right|^{2} \right\} \cdot \tau^{2}\exp\left\{ - \theta_{t}\left| t_{1} - t_{2} \right| \right\}.\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span></td>

<p>Which depends on both the features of routes <span class="math inline">\(j_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j_{2}\)</span>, and
the time points <span class="math inline">\(t_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_{2}\)</span>, which we refer to as the spatial
and temporal covariance structures, respectively.</p>
<p>Denote the log-transformed intensity of the OD traffic demand on day <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
as
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}_{i} = \left( u_{i11},u_{i12},\ldots,u_{\text{iJT}} \right)^{&#39;}\)</span>.
We can further derive that conditioning on parameters
<span class="math inline">\(\left( \mathbf{\mu},\ \theta_{y},\theta_{t},\mathbf{\sigma,\ }\tau^{2} \right)\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}_{i}\)</span> follows normal distribution
<span class="math inline">\(N\left( \mathbf{\mu},\ \mathbf{\Sigma} \right)\)</span>, where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbf{\mu} = \left( \mu_{11},\mu_{12},\ \cdots,\ \mu_{\text{JT}} \right)^{&#39;},\]</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math display">\[\mathbf{\Sigma} = \mathbf{R}_{\theta_{y}}\bigotimes\left\lbrack \mathbf{R}_{B} + \tau^{2}\mathbf{R}_{\theta_{t}} \right\rbrack.\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here, the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\bigotimes\)</span> denotes the Kronecker product,
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}_{B}\)</span> is a fixed <span class="math inline">\(T \times T\)</span> matrix with the <span class="math inline">\((t_{1},t_{2})\)</span>
element equal to <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{k = 1}^{K}{B_{k}(t_{1})B_{k}(t_{2})}\)</span>, and
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}_{\theta_{t}}\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(T \times T\)</span> matrix with the
<span class="math inline">\((t_{1},t_{2})\)</span> element equal to
<span class="math inline">\(\exp\left\{ - \theta_{t}|t_{1} - t_{2}| \right\}\)</span>. Therefore, the large
covariance matrix is parametrized based on only the parameters
<span class="math inline">\(\theta_{y},\theta_{t},\mathbf{\sigma}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau^{2}\)</span>. This
parsimonious model has several advantages, such as high interpretability
tailored to the traffic demand count data, increased stability of the
estimation results, and reduced computational burden for parameter
estimation. We treat <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span> as a latent variable and further
employ the EM algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) for the parameters.</p>
<p>In this way, we can fully explore the complicated spatiotemporal
correlation structure of the traffic network demand and automatically
cluster the routes with high correlations, without introducing a large
number of parameters that impact the estimation accuracy. Besides
transportation systems, the proposed method can be easily extended to
other network applications with count data through few modifications,
such as communication systems, supply chain management, smart grid, or
even three-dimensional networks (Wang et al., 2018).</p>
<p><strong>Case study</strong></p>
<p>We apply the proposed method to a real New York yellow taxi dataset
which is collected from June 1<sup>st</sup> to July 31<sup>st</sup> in 2017 (NYC taxi,
2017). The dataset records all yellow taxi trips during the
aforementioned time period including the pick-up and drop-off dates and
times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, and payment
information about the trips. We focus on the trips between the four
busiest zones in Manhattan and investigate the structure of the travel
demand counts on these zones as OD pairs. The details of the four taxi
zones are shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Figure 2 further shows the specific taxi demand prediction results of
two routes <span class="math inline">\((4,\ 3)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((4,\ 4)\)</span> for four test days. The solid black
line in this figure represents the true dynamic traffic demand counts,
where it can be observed that the true taxi demand indeed exhibits high
spatial and temporal variation and strong correlations for observations
between the routes and across different epochs. The solid red line in is
the predicted demand using the proposed method, and the dashed error
bars show the 90% confidence interval of the prediction based on the
variance derivation in equation (7), which significantly outperforms the
existing method shown in black dotted line.</p>
