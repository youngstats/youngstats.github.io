<h1>Disclosure risk for microdata</h1>
<p>Protection against disclosure is a legal and ethical obligation for
agencies releasing microdata files for public use. Consider a microdata
sample <span class="math inline">\({X}_n=(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})\)</span> of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> from a finite
population of size <span class="math inline">\(\bar{n}=n+\lambda n\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&gt;0\)</span>, such that
each sample record <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> contains two disjoint types of information:
identifying categorical information and sensitive information.
Identifying information consists of a set of categorical variables which
might be matchable to known units of the population. A risk of
disclosure results from the possibility that an intruder might succeed
in identifying a microdata unit through such a matching, and hence be
able to disclose sensitive information on this unit. To quantify the
risk of disclosure, sample records <span class="math inline">\({X}_n\)</span> are typically
cross-classified according to identifying variables. That is, <span class="math inline">\({X}_n\)</span>
is partitioned in <span class="math inline">\(K_{n}\leq n\)</span> cells, with <span class="math inline">\(Y_{j,n}\)</span> being the number
of <span class="math inline">\(X_{i}\)</span>’s belonging to cell <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(j=1,\ldots, K_{n}\)</span>, such that
<span class="math inline">\(\sum_{1\leq j\leq K_{n}}Y_{j,n}=n\)</span>; we refer to the number of
occurrences <span class="math inline">\(Y_{j,n}\)</span> as the sample frequency of cell <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. We also
indicate by <span class="math inline">\(Y_{j,\bar{n}}\)</span> the same quantities referring to the entire
population of size <span class="math inline">\(\bar{n}\)</span>. Then, a risk of disclosure arises from
cells in which both sample frequencies and population frequencies are
small. Of special interest are cells with frequency <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (singletons or
uniques) since, assuming no errors in the matching process or data
sources, for these cells the match is guaranteed to be correct. This has
motivated inferences on measures of disclosure risk that are suitable
functionals of the number of uniques, the most common being the number
<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{1}\)</span> of sample uniques which are also population uniques, namely
the following functional:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau_{1}=\sum_{j\geq 1}\mathbf{1}_{\{Y_{j,n}=1\}}\mathbf{1}_{\{Y_{j,\bar{n}}=1\}},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> denotes the indicator function.</p>
<p>We first introduce a class of nonparametric estimators of <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{1}\)</span>, we
then show that they provably estimate <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{1}\)</span> all of the way up to
the sampling fraction <span class="math inline">\((\lambda+1)^{-1}\propto (\log n)^{-1}\)</span>, with
vanishing normalized mean squared error (NMSE) for large sample size
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. More importantly we prove that
<span class="math inline">\((\lambda+1)^{-1}\propto (\log n)^{-1}\)</span> is the smallest possible
sampling fraction for consistently estimating <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{1}\)</span>, thus the
estimators’ NMSE is near optimal. Our paper also provides a rigorous
answer to an open question raised by Skinner and Elliot (2002) about the feasibility of nonparametric estimation of <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{1}\)</span> and for a sampling fraction
<span class="math inline">\((\lambda+1)^{-1}&lt;1/2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="nonparametric-estimation-of-tau_1" class="section level1">
<h1>Nonparametric estimation of <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{1}\)</span></h1>
<p>A nonparametric estimator for <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span> may be simply deduced by
comparing expectations. Indeed, under a suitable Poisson abundance model
for the cells’ proportions, it easy to see that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{eq:comparingE}
\mathbb{E} [\tau_1] =  \sum_{i \geq 0}(-1)^i \lambda^i (i+1) \mathbb{E} [Z_{i+1, n}],\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Z_{i,n}\)</span> denotes the number of cells with frequency <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> out of
the sample <span class="math inline">\({X}_n\)</span>. Thus, according to identity , we can define the
following estimator of <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{eq:estimator&lt;1}
\hat{\tau}_{1}=\sum_{i \geq 0} (-1)^{i} (i+1)\lambda^{i}Z_{i+1}.\]</span></p>
<p>By construction, the estimator is unbiased and it admits a natural
interpretation as a nonparametric empirical Bayes estimator in the sense
of Robbins(1956). The use of estimator is legitimated under the assumption
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda&lt;1\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \geq 1\)</span> it becomes useless, because of its
high variance due to the exponential growth of the coefficients
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda^i\)</span>. Unfortunately, the assumption <span class="math inline">\(\lambda &lt; 1\)</span> is
unrealistic in the context of disclosure risk assessment, where the size
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda n\)</span> of the unobserved population is typically much bigger than
the size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of the observed sample. Thus the estimator requires an
adjustment via suitable smoothing techniques, along similar lines as
Orlitsky et al. (2016) in the context of the nonparametric estimation of the number of unseen species. We propose a smoothed version of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_{1}\)</span> by
truncating the series at an independent random location <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, and then
averaging over the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, i.e.,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:estimator&gt;1}
\hat{\tau}_{1}^L&amp;= {\mathbb{E}}_L \left[ \sum_{i =1}^L (-1)^{i} (i+1) \lambda^i Z_{i+1,n}\right],\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is supposed to be a Poisson or a Binomial random variable, but
other choices are possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="main-results" class="section level1">
<h1>Main results</h1>
<p>We have evaluated the performance of the estimator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_{1}^L\)</span> in
terms of the normalized mean squared error (NMSE). The NMSE is the mean
squared error (MSE) of the estimator normalized by the maximum value of
<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{1}\)</span> (which is exactly <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>). Thus, the performance of an estimator
is evaluated in terms of the rate of convergence to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> of the NMSE as
<span class="math inline">\(n \to +\infty\)</span>. See also Orlitsky et al. (2016) for a definition of NMSE. In our
paper we have proved that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_{1}^L\)</span> provably estimate
<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{1}\)</span> all of the way up to the sampling fraction
<span class="math inline">\((\lambda+1)^{-1}\propto (\log n)^{-1}\)</span> of the population, with
vanishing normalized mean-square error (NMSE) as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> becomes large.
Then, by relying on recent techniques developed in Wu and Yang (2019) in
the context of nonparametric estimation of the support size of discrete
distributions, we are also able to provide us with a lower bound for the
NMSE of any estimator of the disclosure risk <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span>. The lower bound
we find has an important implication: without imposing any parametric
assumption on the model, one can estimate <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span> with vanishing NMSE
all the way up to <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \propto \log n\)</span>. It is then impossible to
determine an estimator having provable guarantees, in terms of vanishing
NMSE, when <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = \lambda (n)\)</span> goes to <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span> much faster than
<span class="math inline">\(\log (n)\)</span>, as a function of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Moreover it follows that the ``limit
of predictability" of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_{1}^L\)</span> in is near optimal, because it
matches (asymptotically) with its maximum possible value
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda \propto \log (n)\)</span>, under suitable choices of the smoothing
distribution <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1: The normalized mean squared error as a function of the sampling
fraction <span class="math inline">\((1+\lambda)^{-1}\)</span> when the cell’s probabilities are uniform
distributed. Each curve corresponds to a different estimator of
<span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span>: i) the nonparametric estimator with Binomial smoothing
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_1^{L_b}\)</span>; ii) the nonparametric estimator with Poisson
smoothing <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_1^{L_p}\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>The performance of our nonparametric approach is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>In order to do that, we generated a collection of synthetic
tables with <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> cells, where <span class="math inline">\(C=3 \cdot 10^6\)</span>. The population size is
fixed to <span class="math inline">\(\bar{n}=10^{6}\)</span>, and we evaluated the NMSE for different
values of the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n=\bar{n}(\lambda+1)^{-1}\)</span>. The underlying
true cells’ probabilities are generated according to a uniform
distribution over the total number of cells. The figure shows how the
NMSE varies as a function of the sampling fraction <span class="math inline">\((1+\lambda)^{-1}\)</span>,
for the estimator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_1^L\)</span>, under a Poisson and a Binomial
smoothing. All the estimates are averaged over 100 iterations. The
sampling fractions considered in our simulation study are above the
limiting threshold <span class="math inline">\((\log n)^{-1}\)</span> and the better performance seems to
be achieved under the Binomial smoothing.</p>
