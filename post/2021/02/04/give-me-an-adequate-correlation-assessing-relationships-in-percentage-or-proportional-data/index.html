<div id="correlations-and-negative-bias" class="section level2">
<h2>Correlations and negative bias</h2>
<p>We assume that you are quite familiar with the following problem.
Consider a data set where the information is expressed in percentages or proportions.
An example are household expenditures, given as average amounts (in Euros) the households
are spending on food, housing, transportation, etc.
Since the expenditures would not be comparable among countries with very different economic
level, it makes sense to express the data as proportions (or percentages) of the single
categories on the total expenditures.
Now one can be interested in relationships between the different variables (expenditure
categories), and the common tools for this task would be to use the
Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient to determine the strength of the associations.
However, is this appropriate to compute correlations from
percentages (or proportions, or any other constrained data), or more generally, from data
carrying relative information? Denote the underlying variables, expressed in proportions
or percentages, by <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\ldots,x_D\)</span>.
When computing correlations, we
must count with a negative bias of the covariance, which leads to relations like
<span class="math display">\[\mathrm{cov}(x_1,x_2)+\mathrm{cov}(x_1,x_3)+\ldots+\mathrm{cov}(x_1,x_D)=-\mathrm{var}(x_1).\]</span>
Consequently, the correlation coefficients cannot vary freely between <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>;
they are forced towards negative values and thus do not produce reliable and interpretable results.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-choice-variation-matrix" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial choice: variation matrix</h2>
<p>The way to obtain reasonable correlations with percentage data is to consider ratios,
or even mathematically easier, log-ratios as the source information. Log-ratios do not
change when the data are rescaled, thus the sum of components (100 for percentages) is
even irrelevant.
In our household expenditure data set we could thus even work with the raw data, expressed
in Euros, and the results of the analysis would be the same as for the
normalized data.
The scale invariant data are called <em>compositional</em> in this context.
A natural way to assess strength of relationship between components of percentage
(compositional) data is thus to think in terms of their <em>proportionality</em>. This leads
to the so called <em>variation matrix</em>, which is defined as
<span class="math display">\[\mathbf{T}=\left(\mathrm{var}\left(\ln\frac{x_i}{x_j}\right)\right)_{i,j=1}^D.\]</span>
If the components are proportional, the respective element of the variation matrix is
zero, and vice versa. Thus, bigger values of the variation matrix refer to deviations
from proportionality. Here, <em>var</em> is denotes the variance, and practically one can
use classical or robust variance estimation, where the latter is preferable in presence
of outliers.
The variation matrix is thus definitely a reasonable choice to express relationship
between the variables, however, it cannot be interpreted in terms of correlations,
as possible negative relationships between the components are not captured.</p>
</div>
<div id="correlations-with-weighted-symmetric-pivot-coordinates" class="section level2">
<h2>Correlations with (weighted) symmetric pivot coordinates</h2>
<p>We can see that relating the original components has its clear limitations. A possible
alternative could be to consider <em>relative information</em> carried by the original components
of a given composition, information contained in log-ratios to other components. The first
choice is to aggregate these logratios which leads, say for components <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>,
to the following variables (we refer to <em>symmetric pivot coordinates</em>):
<span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
z_1^s&amp;=&amp;C\left(\frac{\sqrt{D-2}}{\sqrt{D-2}+\sqrt{D}}\ln\frac{x_1}{x_2}+\ln\frac{x_1}{x_3}+\ldots+\ln\frac{x_1}{x_D}\right),\\
z_2^s&amp;=&amp;C\left(\frac{\sqrt{D-2}}{\sqrt{D-2}+\sqrt{D}}\ln\frac{x_2}{x_1}+\ln\frac{x_2}{x_3}+\ldots+\ln\frac{x_2}{x_D}\right),
\end{eqnarray}\]</span>
with a normalizing positive constant <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. The first logratios in both variables are downscaled in order to remove a possible negative bias (from a geometrical perspective, we are talking about <em>orthonormality</em> of the resulting variables/coordinates); interestingly, <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{D-2}/(\sqrt{D-2}+\sqrt{D})\rightarrow 1/2\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(D\rightarrow\infty\)</span>. Even more, the effect of pairwise logratios which are aggregated into <span class="math inline">\(z_1^s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_2^s\)</span> can be <em>weighted</em>, e.g., according to their proportionality to <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, respectively, by using the inverse values of the respective elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}\)</span>. This guarantees that components not related to <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> have a limited impact to
the construction of both symmetric pivot coordinates.</p>
<p>Now, standard (classical or robust) correlation coefficients between <span class="math inline">\(z_1^s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_2^s\)</span> can be computed to estimate the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> in the composition.
Its interpretation follows directly the construction of symmetric pivot coordinates. This means that the original components are replaced by their <em>dominance</em> over
“averaged” contributions of the other components (ev. appropriately weighted) – a quite natural interpretation for data carrying relative information. Moreover, the correlation can be considered in both the positive and negative sense without any danger of the negative bias. We should be only aware that each correlation coefficient is coming from a set of coordinates which are constructed specifically for the given couple of components, so the resulting “correlation matrix” should not be simply treated in the multivariate sense.</p>
</div>
<div id="relative-structure-of-household-expenditures" class="section level2">
<h2>Relative structure of household expenditures</h2>
<p>Let us come back to the initial example where the interest was in the relative structure of household expenditures, reported for several countries of the European Union.
Such a data set is contained as <code>expendituresEU</code> in the library <code>robCompositions</code>. With a
proportional representation of the expenditures the wealth status of countries is
suppressed and the focus is on the <em>relative</em> correlation structure. In order to suppress the influence of outlying observations, the Spearman correlation coefficients between
the components are computed and the result is plotted in the heatmap below.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-02-04-correlation/Raw_data_correlation.jpg" /></p>
<p>There are some strongly related groups of components visible, like <em>Foodstuff</em>, <em>Alcohol</em> and <em>Communications</em>, which could be considered as those belonging to “basic” expenditures, and there is also another related group of components which could be connected rather to wealth of households (<em>Recreation</em>, <em>Furnishing</em>, <em>Transport</em> and <em>Other</em>). On the other hand, there are also some strongly negatively correlated couples of components, like <em>Food</em> with <em>Recreation</em>, <em>Other</em> and <em>Furnishings</em>, respectively, or <em>Recreation</em> and <em>Health</em>. The question is which of these negative correlation coefficients is a consequence of the negative bias, and which indeed reflects strong negative relationship between the <em>relative</em> household expenditures.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-02-04-correlation/Variation_matrix.jpg" /></p>
<p>As the next step we want to see whether these relationships can be observed also in the (robust) variation matrix, working with log-ratios instead of the original components. Indeed, the proportionality holds definitely for the first group of components (<em>Foodstuff</em>, <em>Alcohol</em> and <em>Communications</em>), however, proportionality of supplementary expenditures is now structured differently (see, e.g., a strong relationship between the components <em>Recreation</em> and <em>Other</em>). In any case, any “negative proportionality” cannot be derived from the variation matrix.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-02-04-correlation/Sym_coordinates.jpg" /></p>
<p>Therefore, we turn to symmetric pivot coordinates; they can be computed, similarly as the variation matrix, using the <code>robCompositions</code> package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(robCompositions)
data(expendituresEU)
D &lt;- ncol(expendituresEU)
Rs &lt;- matrix(NA,nrow=D,ncol=D)

colnames(Rs) &lt;- colnames(expendituresEU)
for(i in 1:D){
  for(j in 1:D){
    Z &lt;- pivotCoord(expendituresEU[,c(i,j, (1:D)[-c(i,j)])],method=&quot;symm&quot;)
  Rs[i,j] &lt;- cor(Z[,1:2],method=&quot;spearman&quot;)[1,2]
  }
}
round(Rs,2)</code></pre>

<p>Now the correlations are not computed from the original components and we have to refer to their dominance over averaged contributions of the other components instead, but the negative bias of correlations is eliminated now. Indeed, when looking at the heatmap, the main clusters of strongly positively correlated components remain unchanged. However, more substantial changes can be observed for negative correlations. From those mentioned previously only that one between <em>Food</em> and <em>Other</em> (in the symmetric pivot coordinates sense) remained. Nevertheless, we should be aware that for the computation of correlations we simply aggregated all log-ratios of the couple with the remaining components, and there are clearly those which could strongly influence the resulting symmetric pivot coordinates, although they are not related to any of components of interest. This is definitely the case of <em>Education</em>, which is not proportional to the vast majority of components (see heatmap of the variation matrix), and whose influence should thus be rather suppressed.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-02-04-correlation/Weighted_symm_coordinates.jpg" /></p>
<p>This can be done by using weighted symmetric pivot coordinates, the grouping of positively correlated components is now suprisingly even more similar to the case of the initial proportional data. Of course, by considering a different interpretation of the “components” in both cases! However, now we are free again from any possible negative bias of correlations. The “tuned” symmetric pivot coordinates reveal three negative relationships, those between <em>Recreation</em> and <em>Health</em>, <em>Food</em> and <em>Other</em>, and also <em>Restaurants</em> and <em>Communications</em>. All of them have a quite intuitive interpretation and support the <strong>take-home message</strong> that (weighted) symmetric pivot coordinates are a reasonable alternative to correlations of proportional or percentage data.</p>
