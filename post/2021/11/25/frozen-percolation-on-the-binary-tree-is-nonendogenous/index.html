<p>In frozen percolation on a graph, there is a barrier located on each
edge. Initially, the barriers are closed and they are assigned
i.i.d. uniformly distributed activation times. At its activation time,
a barrier opens, provided it is not frozen. At a fixed set <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\)</span> of
freezing times, all barriers that percolate are frozen. In particular,
if <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\)</span> is the whole unit interval, this means that clusters stop
growing as soon as they reach infinite size. Aldous (2000) showed that
such a process can be constructed on the infinite 3-regular tree. He
also proved uniqueness in law under natural conditions and asked
whether almost sure uniqueness holds. We answer this question
negatively. For general sets of freezing times, the answer turns out
to depend subtly on <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\)</span>.</p>
<div id="definition-of-the-model" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Definition of the model</h2>
<p>To construct frozen percolation on a directed graph, we place a
<em>barrier</em> on each directed edge. These barriers can be in three states:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-11-25-frozen-percolation-on-the-binary-tree-is-nonendogenous_files/screenshot-66.png" style="width:60.0%" /></p>
<p>We assign i.i.d. Unif<span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> <em>activation times</em>
<span class="math inline">\((\tau_\mathbf{i})_{\mathbf{i}\in{\mathbb B}}\)</span> to the barriers
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{i}\in{\mathbb B}\)</span>, and we fix a closed set <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\subset[0,1]\)</span> of
<em>freezing times</em>. The states of barriers evolve according to the
following informal description:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initially, all barriers are closed.</p></li>
<li><p>At its activation time, a barrier opens, provided it is not frozen.</p></li>
<li><p>At each freezing time <span class="math inline">\(t\in\Xi\)</span>, all closed barriers that percolate
are frozen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we say that a barrier percolates if there starts an infinite open
path just above it:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-11-25-frozen-percolation-on-the-binary-tree-is-nonendogenous_files/screenshot-71.png" style="width:60.0%" /></p>
<p>More formally, we set <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{r@{\,}c@{\,}l}
\displaystyle{\mathbb A}_t&amp;:=&amp;\displaystyle\big\{\mathbf{i}\in{\mathbb B}:\tau_\mathbf{i}\leq t\big\},\\[5pt]
\displaystyle{\mathbb F}&amp;:=&amp;\displaystyle\big\{\mathbf{i}\in{\mathbb B}:\mathbf{i}\mbox{ is frozen at the final time }1\big\}.
\end{array}\]</span> Then <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb A}_t\backslash{\mathbb F}\)</span> is the set of
barriers that are open at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. We write
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{i}\overset{{{\mathbb A}_t\backslash{\mathbb F}}}{\longrightarrow}\infty\)</span>
if <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{i}\)</span> percolates at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Then the <em>Frozen Percolation
Equation</em> reads:
<span class="math display">\[{\mathbb F}=\big\{\mathbf{i}\in{\mathbb B}:\mathbf{i}\overset{{{\mathbb A}_t\backslash{\mathbb F}}}{\longrightarrow}\infty
\mbox{ for some }t\in(0,\tau_\mathbf{i}]\cap\Xi\big\}\qquad({\rm FPE}).\]</span>
It is clear from our informal description that if <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\)</span> is finite, then
(FPE) has a solution <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb F}\)</span>, which is a.s. unique given the
activation times <span class="math inline">\((\tau_\mathbf{i})_{\mathbf{i}\in{\mathbb B}}\)</span>. For
general <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\)</span> and general directed graphs, one can ask whether solutions
exist and whether they are unique in distribution or perhaps even almost
surely.</p>
<p>Frozen precolation can also be defined on undirected graphs. Just
replace each undirected edge by two directed edges whose barriers are
activated at the same time. The case <span class="math inline">\(\Xi=[0,1]\)</span> is of special interest,
since in this case clusters freeze as soon as they reach infinite size,
which leads to self-organised criticality. For this reason, in the year
2000 David Aldous introduced frozen percolation (Aldous, 2000). He proved that
the frozen percolation equation (FPE) has a solution on the undriected
3-regular tree, and that under natural assumptions this solution is
unique in law. On the other hand, Itai Benjamini and Oded Schramm
observed that (FPE) does not have a solution on the two-dimensional
integer lattice. A sketch of their proof can be found in Section 3 of
(van den Berg and Tóth, 2001).</p>
<p>If from the directed binary tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, we remove a finite subtree <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>
containing the root, then <span class="math inline">\(T\backslash U\)</span> consists of finitely many
disjoint subtrees <span class="math inline">\(T_1,\ldots,T_n\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-11-25-frozen-percolation-on-the-binary-tree-is-nonendogenous_files/screenshot-70.png" style="width:60.0%" /></p>
<p>We say that a solution <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb F}\)</span> satisfies the <em>natural conditions</em>
if its restrictions to <span class="math inline">\(T_1,\ldots,T_n\)</span> are i.i.d., equally distributed
with the process on the whole tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and independent of the
activation times in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. We label barriers in the obvious way and let
<span class="math inline">\([\mathbf{i}]\)</span> denote the vertex just below <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{i}\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-11-25-frozen-percolation-on-the-binary-tree-is-nonendogenous_files/screenshot-68.png" style="width:60.0%" /></p>
<p>It is easy to see that the freezing time of the root
<span class="math display">\[Y_{[\varnothing]}:=\inf\big\{t\in\Xi:[\varnothing]\overset{{{\mathbb A}_t\backslash{\mathbb F}}}{\longrightarrow}\infty\big\}\]</span>
solves the <em>Recursive Distributional Equation</em>
<span class="math display">\[Y_{[\varnothing]}\stackrel{\scriptstyle{\rm d}}{=}\gamma(\tau_\varnothing,Y_{[1]},Y_{[2]}):=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
Y_{[1]}\wedge Y_{[2]}\quad&amp;\mbox{if }\tau_\varnothing&lt;Y_{[1]}\wedge Y_{[2]},\\[5pt]
\infty\quad&amp;\mbox{otherwise,}
\end{array}\right.\quad({\rm RDE}),\]</span> where, because the solution to
(FPE) saties the natural conditions, <span class="math inline">\(Y_{[1]},Y_{[2]}\)</span> are independent
of each other and equally distributed with <span class="math inline">\(Y_{[\varnothing]}\)</span>, and
<span class="math inline">\(\tau_\varnothing\)</span> is an independent Unif<span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> distributed random
variable.</p>
<p>The following theorem is a free formulation of of Theorem 1 and Lemma 5
from (Ráth, Swart and Szőke, 2021), which using Proposition 42 of (Ráth, Swart and Terpai, 2021) are translated
into the present setting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> For each closed <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\subset[0,1]\)</span>, there exists a unique
solution to (RDE) that yields a solution <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb F}\)</span> to (FPE). In
particular, for each closed <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\subset[0,1]\)</span>, (FPE) has a solution
that satisfies the natural conditions, and the joint law of
<span class="math inline">\(\big(\tau_\mathbf{i})_{\mathbf{i}\in{\mathbb B}},{\mathbb F}\big)\)</span> is
uniquely determined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the case <span class="math inline">\(\Xi=[0,1]\)</span>, this theorem was (basically) already proved in
(Aldous, 2000) by Aldous, who showed that in this case the freezing time of
the root has the law
<span class="math display">\[{\mathbb P}\big[Y_{[\varnothing]}&gt;y\big]=1\wedge\frac{1}{2y}\qquad\big(y\in[0,1]\big),\]</span>
with
<span class="math inline">\({\mathbb P}\big[Y_{[\varnothing]}=\infty\big]={\textstyle\frac{{1}}{{2}}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To study almost sure uniqueness in this and related problems, David
Aldous and Antar Bandyopadhyay (Aldous and Bandyopadhyay, 2005) developed a general theory of
<em>Recursive Tree Processes</em>. In the general setting, almost sure
uniqueness is called <em>endogeny</em>. Let <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb F},{\mathbb F}&#39;\)</span> be
solutions to (FPE) that satisfy the natural conditions and are
conditionally independent given
<span class="math inline">\((\tau_\mathbf{i})_{\mathbf{i}\in{\mathbb B}}\)</span>. Then
<span class="math inline">\((Y_{[\varnothing]},Y&#39;_{[\varnothing]})\)</span> solves the <em>bivariate RDE</em>
<span class="math display">\[(Y_{[\varnothing]},Y&#39;_{[\varnothing]})\stackrel{\scriptstyle{\rm d}}{=}
\big(\gamma(\tau_\varnothing,Y_{[1]},Y_{[2]}),\gamma(\tau_\varnothing,Y&#39;_{[1]},Y&#39;_{[2]})\big),\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the function from (RDE). In Theorem 11 of (Aldous and Bandyopadhyay, 2005), it
is proved that <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb F}={\mathbb F}&#39;\)</span> a.s. if and only if each
solution to the bivariate RDE with the right marginals is concentrated
on the diagonal. After a failed proof of endogeny that turned out to
contain an error (Bandyopadhyay, 2004), Antar Bandyopadhyay ran numerical
calculations that strongly suggested almost sure uniqueness does not
hold, but for 15 years nobody was able to prove this.</p>
<p>We discovered the problem becomes easier if we place a geometrically
distributed number of barriers with mean one on each edge.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-11-25-frozen-percolation-on-the-binary-tree-is-nonendogenous_files/screenshot-67.png" style="width:60.0%" /></p>
<p>We call this the <em>Marked Binary Branching Tree</em> (MBBT). The MBBT
naturally arises as the near-critical scaling limit of percolation on
regular trees. Since it is itself a scaling limit, the MBBT has a
natural scaling property. For fixed <span class="math inline">\(r\in[0,1]\)</span>, the <em>pruned</em> MBBT is
obtained by removing all parts of the tree that do not percolate at time
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> even in the absence of freezing. For the MBBT,
<span class="math inline">\({\mathbb P}\big[[\varnothing]\overset{{{\mathbb A}_r}}{\longrightarrow}\infty\big]=r\)</span>
and conditional on this event, the pruned tree is equally distributed
with a scaled version of the original tree.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-11-25-frozen-percolation-on-the-binary-tree-is-nonendogenous_files/screenshot-69.png" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>The bivariate RDE gives an integral equation for
<span class="math display">\[F(s,t):={\mathbb P}\big[Y_{[\varnothing]}\leq s,\ Y&#39;_{[\varnothing]}\leq t\big].\]</span>
For the MBBT, scaling gives <span class="math inline">\(F(rs,rt)=rF(s,t)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\((r,s,t\in[0,1])\)</span>. The
bivariate RDE now reduces to an integral equation for a function of one
variable, which is easier to solve than the original bivariate RDE for
the binary tree. However, as demonstrated in Proposition 42 of (Ráth, Swart and Terpai, 2021),
frozen percolation on the binary tree and on the MBBT can be translated
into each other. The basic idea is that several barriers on one oriented
edge can be replaced by a single effective barrier, whose activation
time is the maximum of the activation times of the individual barriers.
As a result, we were able to obtain Theorem 3 of (Ráth, Swart and Terpai, 2021), which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> For frozen percolation on the binary tree with
<span class="math inline">\(\Xi=[0,1]\)</span>, solutions to (FPE) are not almost surely unique.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In (Ráth, Swart and Szőke, 2021) we investigated almost sure uniqueness for frozen
percolation on the MBBT for sets of freezing times of the form
<span class="math inline">\(\Xi_\theta:=\{\theta^n:n\geq 0\}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;\theta&lt;1\)</span>. These sets behave
well under scaling, so we were able to use the same techniques as in
(Ráth, Swart and Terpai, 2021). To translate this back from the MBBT into the setting of the
binary tree, one has to replace <span class="math inline">\(\Xi_\theta\)</span> by its image under the map
<span class="math inline">\(H(t):=1/(2-t)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\((t\in[0,1])\)</span>. Theorem 9 of (Ráth, Swart and Szőke, 2021) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> For frozen percolation on the MBBT and sets of freezing
times of the form <span class="math inline">\(\Xi_\theta\)</span>, there exists a parameter
<span class="math inline">\(\theta^\ast=0.636\ldots\)</span> such that, if <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb F},{\mathbb F}&#39;\)</span> are
solutions to (FPE) for <span class="math inline">\(\Xi_\theta\)</span>, that satisfy the natural
conditions and are conditionally independent given
<span class="math inline">\((\tau_\mathbf{i})_{\mathbf{i}\in{\mathbb B}}\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\({\mathbb F}={\mathbb F}&#39;\)</span> a.s. if and only if
<span class="math inline">\(\theta\leq\theta^\ast\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have an explicit formula for the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\ast\)</span> (see Lemma 8
in (Ráth, Swart and Szőke, 2021)), which is rather complicated. The result shows that in
general, one cannot hope to settle the question of almost sure
uniqueness by “soft” arguments. Instead, any proof will always require
some hard calculations.</p>
<p>A number of open problems remain, notably:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We don’t know if distributional or almost sure uniqueness still hold
if we drop the natural conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost sure (non-)uniqueness is open for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-regular directed trees
with <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 3\)</span> and for more general sets of freezing times <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\)</span>.
The technical challenge is to replace perfect scale invariance in
the proofs by approximate scale invariance near the critical point.</p></li>
<li><p>Existence and/or uniqueness of solutions to (FPE) on more general
graphs, including <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb Z}^d\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(d\geq 3\)</span>, is wide open.</p></li>
</ul>
