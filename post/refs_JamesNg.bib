The statistical analysis for NHPPs is of interest to both theoreticians and practitioners. In this paper, maximum likelihood estimation under time-truncated sampling is studied for parametric NHPP software reliability models with bounded mean value functions. It is shown that the maximum likelihood estimators need not be consistent or asymptotically normal. The asymptotic distribution is derived for a specific NHPP model.",

The result holds for virtually all known activation functions, including rectified linear units, sigmoids and thresholds, and formally demonstrates that depth – even if increased by 1 – can be exponentially more valuable than width for standard feedforward neural networks. Moreover, compared to related results in the context of Boolean functions, our result requires fewer assumptions, and the proof techniques and construction are very different. }

    abstract = "{We discuss several nonparametric methods for attaching a standard error to a point estimate: the jackknife, the bootstrap, half-sampling, subsampling, balanced repeated replications, the infinitesimal jackknife, influence function techniques and the delta method. The last three methods are shown to be identical. All the methods derive from the same basic idea, which is also the idea underlying the common parametric methods. Extended numerical comparisons are made for the special case of the correlation coefficient.}",
