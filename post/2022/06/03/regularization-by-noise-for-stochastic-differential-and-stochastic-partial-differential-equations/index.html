<p><strong>Regularization by Noise for Stochastic Differential and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations</strong></p>

<p>The regularizing effects of noisy perturbations of differential equations is a central subject of stochastic analysis. Recent breakthroughs initiated a new wave of interest, particularly concerning non-Markovian, infinite dimensional, and rough-stochastic / Young-stochastic hybrid systems.</p>
<p>On the webinar, selected younger scholars will present their recent works on the topic.</p>
<p>When &amp; Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday, September 21st, 7:00 PT / 10:00 EST / 16:00 CET.</li>
<li>Online, via Zoom. The registration form is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdA_UmGknYO3Oo_yqVM80SqgnIZUgEyvINzdOMTI0BzhCMdPw/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1&amp;flr=0">here</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>Abstract: Since the works by Delarue, Diel and Cannizzaro, Chouk (in the Brownian noise setting), and our previous work, the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the martingale problem associated to multidimensional SDEs with additive <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-stable Lévy noise for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> in (1, 2] and rough Besov drift of regularity <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> &gt; (2-2<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>)/3 is known. Motivated by the equivalence of probabilistic weak solutions to SDEs with bounded, measurable drift and solutions to the martingale problem, we define a (non-canonical) weak solution concept for singular Lévy diffusions, proving moreover equivalence to the martingale solution in both the Young (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> &gt; (1-<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>)/2), as well as in the rough regime (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> &gt; (2-2<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>))/3). This turns out to be highly non-trivial in the rough case and forces us to define certain rough stochastic sewing integrals involved. In particular, we show that the canonical weak solution concept (introduced also by Athreya, Butkovsky, Mytnik), which is well-posed in the Young case, yields non-uniqueness of solutions in the rough case. If time permits, we apply our theory to the Brox diffusion with Lévy noise and prove a homogenization result for singular diffusions in the periodic Besov drift setting. The talk is based on joint work with Nicolas Perkowski.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.iam.uni-bonn.de/users/galeati/home">Lucio Galeati</a>, University of Bonn, Germany: <em>Advances on singular SDEs with fractional noise in subcritical regimes</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in regulariaation by noise for SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion of parameter <span class="math inline">\(H\in (0,1)\)</span>, with first results going back to Nualart, Ouknine (2002) and Catellier, Gubinelli (2016). The main challenges when dealing with these equations are the presence of a non-Lipschitz (possibly singular) drift and the lack of any martingale or Markovian structure; in particular, classical stochastic analysis and PDE tools break down for <span class="math inline">\(H\neq 1/2\)</span> and new techniques must be developed. Here I will present some advances on the topic, including generalizations to the regime <span class="math inline">\(H\in (1,\infty)\)</span>, construction of the associated stochastic flow of solutions and stability estimates for SDEs driven by different drifts. The key tools in our analysis come from rough path theory and are given by Young integration and suitable versions of the stochastic sewing lemma. Based on a joint work (arXiv:2207.03475) with M. Gerencser (TU Wien).</p>

<li><a href="http://www.mics.centralesupelec.fr/en/teammics">Lukas Anzeletti</a>, Université Paris-Saclay, France: <em>Regularisation by noise for SDEs with (fractional) Brownian noise and a comparison of different notions of solutions</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract: We study existence and uniqueness of solutions to the equation <span class="math inline">\(X_t=b(X_t)dt + dB_t\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> may be distributional and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter <span class="math inline">\(H\leq 1/2\)</span>. We follow two approaches, namely using the stochastic sewing lemma and nonlinear Young integrals in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-variation. Furthermore, in the Brownian case <span class="math inline">\(H=1/2\)</span> we present examples of drifts in which the classical notion of a solution and solutions in a path-by-path sense coincide, respectively not coincide. Partly based on joint work with Alexandre Richard and Etienne Tanré.</p>

<li><a href="http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~honore/index.html">Igor Honoré</a>, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, France: <em>Selection by vanishing viscosity for the transport equation</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract: We consider a transport equation whose the coefficients can be in a negative Besov space, we provide controls in Hölder spaces of some kind of vanishing viscosity solutions from Kolmogorov equation associated with a stochastic process. We perform a new analysis based on a proxy around the flow associated with regularize coefficients, and thanks to a cut locus technique we obtain a Hölder control which does not depend on the regularity of the coefficients. The regularity only matters for the considered type of solution. As a consequence, we can give a meaning of some product of distributions. Finally, by a fixed point theorem, we can match the coefficient with the solution itself. This is exactly the inviscid Burgers’ equation whose the selection principle allows to avoid the well-known time singularity.</p>
