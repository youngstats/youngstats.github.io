<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Migration is a multifaceted phenomenon including macro-, meso-, and
micro-triggers that, when combined, decide an individual’s final
decision to migrate. Apart from being an essential component of
population change, migration is also an important component of
population estimates and labor market force estimations. Jennissen
(2004) argues that the presence of migrant populations has a favorable
impact on natural population growth since migrants’ age characteristics
and fertility rates are often greater than those of the indigenous
population. Furthermore, the migration problem is far more significant
for population growth in European nations, which are generally seeing a
drop in natural population increase. In this environment, it’s critical
to identify and quantify the factors involved in the decision to
migrate. Income disparities or income inequality, economic development,
the tax system, the economic cycle, the availability of new job
opportunities, unemployment, and other variables have been highlighted
as factors affecting migration by several migration theories (Kumpikaite
and Zickute, 2012). People migrate for a variety of reasons, including
improved living conditions or an escape from adverse circumstances in
their native country. This is the foundation of Lee’s (1966) push and
pull hypothesis, which is one of the primary neo-classical migration
hypotheses. Individuals are influenced by supply-push forces to leave
their home country, while demand-pull variables draw migrants to the
destination country.</p>
<p>Panel data analysis is the study of datasets in which entities are
observed through time and allows for the management of missing variables
without having to examine them. By examining changes in the dependent
variable across time, one may rule out the impact of neglected factors
that fluctuate between entities but remain constant over time. The basic
premise is that if unobserved factors (such as those peculiar to
nations) influence the dependent variable yet stay constant over time,
the changes in the dependent variable must come from other sources.</p>
<p>The notation for panel data will be the following:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation} (x_{1,it}, x_{2,it}, ..., x_{k,it}, y_{it}), i=1,2, ..., n; t=1,2, ..., T \end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>i</em> is the subscript for the entity being observed (in our case
study the country) and <em>t</em> is the subscript for the date at which the
entity is observed (in our case study the year). Using these notations
we would have data for the variables
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation} x_1, x_2, ..., x_k, y \end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>The fixed effects approach</strong></p>
<p>The fixed effects model would be written as:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation} y_{it}=\beta_1 x_{1,it} + \beta_2 x_{2,it} + \dots + \beta_k x_{k,it} + \alpha_i + u_{it} \end{equation}\]</span>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x_{j,it}\)</span> represents the value of regressor <em>j</em>, for entity <em>i</em> and
time period <em>t</em>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span> represents the coefficients of the independent variables,
that do not vary across individuals.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span> represents the entity specific intercepts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The random effects approach</strong></p>
<p>the unobserved variable specific to the individual entity is encompassed
in the error term. The entities will have a common mean value for the
intercept (let’s denote this with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) and the specific differences
in the intercept values of each country would be reflected in an error
term (denoted with <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span>).</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation} y_{it}=\alpha + \sum_{j=1}^{k} \beta_j x_{j,it} + \epsilon_i + u_{it} \end{equation}\]</span>
<p>We will obtain a composite error term, which is composed of
<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span>, the individual (cross section) specific error <span class="math inline">\(u_{it}\)</span> and
a combined cross section and time series error:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation} w_{it}=\epsilon_i + u_{it} \end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus substituting both equations we obtain:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation} y_{it}=\alpha + \sum_{j=1}^{k} \beta_j x_{j,it} + w_{it} \end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The main benefit of using panel data related techniques is that
individual heterogeneity of individual entities (countries) can be
explicitly taken into account in panel data estimation; additionally,
panel data offers “more informative data, more variability, less
collinearity, more degrees of freedom, and more efficiency” by combining
time series and cross-sectional observations (Baltagi, 2001).</p>
<p><strong>The database involved</strong></p>
<p>The Crude Rate of Net Migration plus adjustment is the dependent
variable in both estimated models. It is calculated as the annual ratio
of net migration to the average population. It is expressed in terms of
1000 people (of the average population). The difference between the
total number of immigrants and the total number of emigrants is referred
to as net migration; statistical adjustments refers to adjusting net
migration by taking the difference between total population change and
natural change; the indicator roughly covers the difference between
inward and outward migration. In the model, the variable is called “Net
Migration.”</p>
<p>The independent variables in the models are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unemployment: The long-term unemployment rate is the percentage of
people who have been jobless for more than a year out of the total
number of people who are working.</li>
<li>Earnings (adjusted): The adjusted gross disposable income of
households divided by the PPP (purchasing power parities) of the actual
individual consumption of households and by the entire resident
population (in purchasing power standard (PPS) per inhabitant) yields
gross disposable income of households per capita.</li>
<li>Gini Coefficient (of equivalised disposable income): A relationship
between the cumulative shares of the population disposed based on
equivalised disposable income and the cumulative share of the
equivalised total disposable income received by the population is
defined as the Gini Coefficient (of equivalised disposable income).</li>
<li>Unemployment: The long-term unemployment rate is the percentage of
people who have been jobless for more than a year out of the total
number of people who are working.</li>
<li>Earnings (adjusted): The adjusted gross disposable income of
households divided by the PPP (purchasing power parities) of the actual
individual consumption of households and by the entire resident
population (in purchasing power standard (PPS) per inhabitant) yields
gross disposable income of households per capita.</li>
<li>Poverty: The at-risk-of-poverty rate is the proportion of people whose
equivalised disposable income is less than the risk-of-poverty
threshold, which is set at 60% of the national median equivalised
disposable income.</li>
<li>Economic Freedom: A 0–10 scale that assesses the degree of economic
liberty in five key areas: government size, legal system, sound money,
international trade freedom, and regulation.</li>
<li>Hospital beds: the number of beds available in hospitals; the variable
is calculated per 100,000 people.</li>
<li>Health spending: the overall amount spent on health as a proportion of
GDP ( percent ).</li>
</ul>
<p>Eurostat is the data source for all variables except Economic Freedom.
The Fraser Institute is the source of data for the Economic Freedom
Index. Data was collected for 25 EU nations over a period of 18 years,
from 2000 to 2017.</p>
<p>Figure 1 depicts the dispersion of average Net Migration rates for EU
nations for the period 2000–2017. Lithuania (-8.84), Latvia (-7.19),
and Romania (-7.19) are the nations with the lowest average Net
Migration between 2000 and 2017. (-5.48). Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland, and
Slovakia all had negative Net Migration averages over the time period
studied. This was to be expected, given that these economies in Central
and Eastern Europe are generally migration-sending countries (Jennissen,
2004). Luxembourg, Spain, and Sweden, on the other hand, have the
greatest average Net Migration rates, indicating that they are typically
migrant-receiving nations. The Net Migration Rate’s behavior proposes
that the group of nations be divided into two: typically sending and
traditionally receiving countries.</p>

countries; source: author’s processing in Tableau, based on Eurostat data.</p>
<p>Figure 2 depicts the significant relationship between real GDP/capita,
chain linked volume (2010) in Euro/capita, and net migration rate
(averages from 2000 to 2017 were used). Nations with lower GDP per
capita also have negative or low Net Migration rates, indicating that
“poorer” countries are more likely to be the source of migrant flows
(sending countries). Nations with greater GDP/capita, on the other hand,
have higher migration rates, implying that they are primarily receiving
countries for migrants.</p>

<p>The tendency of Net Migration for old and new member states warrants the
dataset being separated into two categories. It is clear from this
research that the group of New Member States acts as Migrant Sending
Countries for the whole time under consideration, while the Old Member
States operate as Migrant Receiving Countries. As a result, the
empirical application will be split into two parts: one model for the
Old member nations and then another model (Table 1) for the New member
states (Table 2).</p>

<p>The influence of macroeconomic factors on the Crude Rate Net Migration
of European economies was quantified using panel data regression models.
A preliminary study of the dependent variable’s distribution reveals
that the net migration rate differs across Old Member States
(migrant-receiving nations) and New Member States (sending countries for
migrants). As a result, we opt to estimate two models for the two sets
of nations, following Mihi-Ramirez et al. (2017) method’s. Unemployment
rate, per capita income, Gini coefficient, poverty rate, Economic
Freedom Index, and two other characteristics relating to the health
system were included as independent variables (number of beds in
hospitals and health expenditure as percentage in GDP). The analysed
period was 2000 – 2017.</p>
<p>The findings corroborated migratory economic theory. In terms of the
labor market, unemployment is a large and powerful supply push factor
for migration. Only for the Old Member states does income appear as a
key influence, validating the neo-classical economic theory of
migration, which claims that variations in earnings across nations are
one of the main factors driving labor movement (Massey et al, 1993).
Moving on to the social component, the Gini coefficient has been
established as a strong driving force behind migration in both Old and
New Member States. Poverty appears to be a factor with reduced
explanatory power, with a positive coefficient for the Old member states
and no significance for the New member states.</p>
<p>In terms of Economic Freedom, the factor has a considerable beneficial
impact on net migration rates only in the New Member States.</p>
<p>Furthermore, health-related macroeconomic factors were included in the
model, as well as the circular cumulative causation hypothesis, which
states that variations in standard of living across nations are the
primary cause of migration (Massey et al. 1993). The health system, on
the other hand, could not be proven to be a factor of migration.</p>
<p>Because international migration has such a substantial impact on
European population dynamics, understanding and analyzing the factors
that influence international migration is critical. The findings of this
study might be utilized not just to produce migration forecasts, but
also to establish migration policies that would improve migrants’ labor
and social integration.</p>
