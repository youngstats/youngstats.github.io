      <description>Summary
We propose a higher order targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) that only relies on a sequentially and recursively defined set of data-adaptive fluctuations. Without the need to assume the often too stringent higher order pathwise differentiability, the method is practical for implementation and has the potential to be fully computerized.
Background Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) It has been particularly of interest for semiparametric theories and real world practices to make efficient and substitution-based estimation for target quantities that are functions of data distribution.</description>
