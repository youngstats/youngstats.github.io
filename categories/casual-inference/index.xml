      <description>I’ve kindly been invited to share a few words about a recent paper my colleagues and I published in Bayesian Analysis: “Bayesian Regression Tree Models for Causal Inference: Regularization, Confounding, and Heterogeneous Effects”. In that paper, we motivate and describe a method that we call Bayesian causal forests (BCF), which is now implemented in an R package called bcf.
The goal of this post is to work through a simple toy example to illustrate the strengths of BCF.</description>
