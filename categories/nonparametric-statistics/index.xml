      <description>OverviewBayesian nonparametric (BNP) models are a prominent tool for performing flexible inference with a natural quantification of uncertainty. Traditionallly, flexible inference within a homogeneous sample is performed with exchangeable models of the type \(X_1,\dots, X_n|\tilde \mu \sim T(\tilde \mu)\), where \(\tilde \mu\) is a random measure and \(T\) is a suitable transformation. Notable examples for \(T\) include normalization for random probabilities (Regazzini et al., 2003), kernel mixtures for densities (Lo, 1984) and for hazards (Dykstra and Laud, 1981; James, 2005), exponential transformations for survival functions (Doksum, 1974) and cumulative transformations for cumulative hazards (Hjort, 1990).</description>

      <description>Disclosure risk for microdataProtection against disclosure is a legal and ethical obligation foragencies releasing microdata files for public use. Consider a microdatasample \({X}_n=(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})\) of size \(n\) from a finitepopulation of size \(\bar{n}=n+\lambda n\), with \(\lambda&amp;gt;0\), such thateach sample record \(X_i\) contains two disjoint types of information:identifying categorical information and sensitive information.Identifying information consists of a set of categorical variables whichmight be matchable to known units of the population.</description>

      <description>Figure 1: Depth quantile functions for the wine data (d=13), class 2 vs class 3. Blue curves correspond to between class comparisons, red/pink correspond to within class comparisons.
A common technique in modern statistics is the so-called kernel trick, where data is mapped into a (usually) infinite-dimensional feature space, where various statistical tasks can be carried out. Relatedly, we introduce the depth quantile function (DQF), \(q_{ij}(\alpha)\) which similarly maps observations into an infinite dimensional space (the double index will become clear below), though in this case, these new representations of the data are functions of a one-dimensional variable \(\alpha\) which allows plotting.</description>
