      <description>OverviewsssTraditionally the excitation noise of spatial and temporal models is Gaussian. Take, for instance, an AR1 (autoregressive of order 1) process, where the increments \(x_{i+1}-\rho x_i, \ \ |\rho|&amp;lt;1\) are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. However, it is easy to find datasets that contain inherently non-Gaussian features, such as sudden jumps or spikes, that adversely affect the inferences and predictions made from Gaussian models. In this post, we introduce a specific class of non-Gaussian models, their advantages over Gaussian models, and their Bayesian implementation in Stan and R-INLA, two well-established platforms for statistical modeling.</description>

      <description>Recent Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference
In approximate Bayesian computation, likelihood function is intractable and needs to be itself estimated using forward simulations of the statistical model (Beaumont et al., 2002; Marin et al., 2012; Sisson et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2020). Recent years have seen numerous advances in approximate inference methods, which have enabled Bayesian inference in increasingly challenging scenarios involving complex probabilistic models and large datasets.</description>
