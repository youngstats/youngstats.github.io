      <description>Recent challenges in model specification testing based on differentdata structures
Model specification testing is one of the essential methodological tasksin statistics. Recently, with the development of different datastructures, envisioning concepts from classical data setups to otherenvironments becomes very important.
In the webinar, selected young statisticians will present their recentworks and elaborate on different aspects of this topic.
When &amp;amp; Where:
Wednesday, November 9th, 8:00 PT / 11:00 ET / 17:00 CETOnline, via Zoom.</description>

      <description>IntroductionA NHPP defined on \({\cal S} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\) can be fullycharacterized through its intensity function \(\lambda: {\cal S} \rightarrow [0, \infty)\).We present a general model for the intensity function of a non-homogeneous Poissonprocess using measure transport. The model finds its roots in transportation ofprobability measure (Marzouk et al. 2016), an approach that has gainedpopularity recently for its ability to model arbitrary probabilitydensity functions.</description>

      <description>We briefly review the two classical problems of distribution estimationand identity testing (in the context of property testing), then proposeto extend them to a Markovian setting. We will see that the samplecomplexity depends not only on the number of states, but also on thestationary and mixing properties of the chains.
The distribution settingEstimation/Learning. A fundamental problem in statistics is toestimate a probability distribution from independent samples.</description>

      <description>Vector-borne diseases have long presented major challenges to the health of rural communities in the wet tropical regions of the world, but especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In this paper, we describe the contribution that statistical modelling has made to the global elimination programme for one vector-borne disease, onchocerciasis.
Perhaps more than anything else I have written, this paper captures my career journey from stochastic process theory to tropical disease epidemiology.</description>
