      <description>Inclusion Process and Sticky Brownian Motions
The ninth “One World webinar” organized by YoungStatS will take place onFebruary 9th, 2022. Inclusion process (IP) is a stochastic lattice gaswhere particles perform random walks subjected to mutual attraction. Forthe inclusion process in the condensation regime one can extract thatthe scaling limit of two particles is a pair of sticky Brownian motionswhich lead to interesting recent research.</description>

      <description>In frozen percolation on a graph, there is a barrier located on eachedge. Initially, the barriers are closed and they are assignedi.i.d. uniformly distributed activation times. At its activation time,a barrier opens, provided it is not frozen. At a fixed set \(\Xi\) offreezing times, all barriers that percolate are frozen. In particular,if \(\Xi\) is the whole unit interval, this means that clusters stopgrowing as soon as they reach infinite size.</description>
