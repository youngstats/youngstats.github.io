      <description>Stochastic Fluid Dynamics
Wednesday, November 15th, 6:00 PT / 9:00 ET / 15:00 CET
The study of fluid dynamics equations with white forcing is a classical topic in SPDEs and ergodic theory. Recently a new wave of interest, with a shift in focus towards transport noise, has risen, due to its connections with Stochastic Geometric Mechanics, Turbulence, Climate Modelling, Stochastic Parametrization and Uncertainty Quantification
In this webinar, selected young researchers will present their recent works on the topic.</description>

      <description>Passive scalar turbulence is the study of how a scalar quantity, such astemperature or salinity, is transported by an incompressible fluid. Thisprocess is modeled by the advection diffusion equation\[\begin{equation}\partial_tg_t + u_t\cdot\nabla g_t - \kappa \Delta g_t = s_t,\label{eqAD}\tag{AD}\end{equation}\] where \(g_t\) is the scalar quantity, \(u_t\) is anincompressible velocity field, \(\kappa&amp;gt;0\) is the diffusivity parameterand \(s_t\) is a replenishing source. As \(g_t\) evolves, it often settlesinto a statistical steady state and complex self-similar structuresarise due to repeated stretching and folding by the velocity field.</description>

      <description>Rough VolatilityNew insights about the regularity of the instantaneous variance obtainedfrom realized variance data (see Gatheral, Jaisson, and Rosenbaum (2018), Bennedsen, Lunde, and Pakkanen (2021, to appear) and Fukasawa, Takabatake, and Westphal (2019)), have inspiredthe development of so-called rough stochastic volatility modelsin the financial literature. In simple terms, such a model can bedescribed by the following SDE \[\begin{equation}\label{eq:stoch-vol}dS_t = S_t \sqrt{v_t}dB_t,\end{equation}\] where the logarithm of the instantaneous variance process\(v\) behaves similarly to a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurstindex \(0 &amp;lt; H &amp;lt; 1/2\).</description>
