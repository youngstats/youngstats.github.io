      <description>Exchangeable arrays have been studied since the late 70’s (Aldous (1983),Kallenberg (2005)). Eagleson and Weber (1978) and Silverman (1976) establish Strong Law of LargeNumbers and Central Limit Theorems for such arrays. Because non-sparsenetworks and multiway clustering are related to exchangeable arrays,they have received recent attention in statistics and econometrics(Davezies, D’Haultfœuille, and Guyonvarch (2018), Davezies, D’Haultfœuille, and Guyonvarch (2021), Menzel (2018)). We focus below on non-sparse networksand present uniformity results at the basis of the asymptotic normalityof many nonlinear estimators.</description>

      <description>As a scientific community, we must understand how scientific collaboration (SC) works on both the individual and organizational levels to be able to propose R&amp;amp;D policies that are efficient. Unfortunately, the interdependent nature of SC among different levels is often not well considered in empirical studies. To address this issue, we will present the scientometric approach that provides a simultaneous insight into SC patterns on both levels: among researchers (individual level) and organizations (organizational level).</description>
