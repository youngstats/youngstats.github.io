      <description>I’ve kindly been invited to share a few words about a recent paper my colleagues and I published in Bayesian Analysis: “Bayesian Regression Tree Models for Causal Inference: Regularization, Confounding, and Heterogeneous Effects”. In that paper, we motivate and describe a method that we call Bayesian causal forests (BCF), which is now implemented in an R package called bcf.
The goal of this post is to work through a simple toy example to illustrate the strengths of BCF.</description>

      <description>As per the records of the World Health Organization, the first formally reported incidence of Zika virus occurred in Brazil in May 2015. The disease then rapidly spread to other countries in Americas and East Asia, affecting more than 1,000,000 people. Zika virus is primarily transmitted through bites of infected mosquitoes of the species Aedes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus). The abundance of mosquitoes and, as a result, the prevalence of Zika virus infections are common in areas which have high precipitation, high temperature, and high population density.</description>
