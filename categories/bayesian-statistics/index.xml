      <description>In recent years, a surprising number of scientific results have failedto hold up to continued scrutiny. Part of this ‘replicability crisis’may be caused by practices that ignore the assumptions of traditional(frequentist) statistical methods (John, Loewenstein, and Prelec 2012). One ofthese assumptions is that the experimental protocol should be completelydetermined upfront. In practice, researchers often adjust the protocoldue to unforeseen circumstances or collect data until a point has beenproven.</description>
