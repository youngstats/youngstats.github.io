      <description>body {text-align: justify}AbstractCo-clustering techniques, which group observations and features simultaneously, have proven to be efficient in summarising data sets. They exploit the dualism between rows and columns and the data set is summarized in blocks (the crossing of a row-cluster and a column-cluster). However, in the case of mixed data sets (with features of different kind), it is not easy to define a co-clustering method that takes this heterogeneity into account.</description>

      <description>As a scientific community, we must understand how scientific collaboration (SC) works on both the individual and organizational levels to be able to propose R&amp;amp;D policies that are efficient. Unfortunately, the interdependent nature of SC among different levels is often not well considered in empirical studies. To address this issue, we will present the scientometric approach that provides a simultaneous insight into SC patterns on both levels: among researchers (individual level) and organizations (organizational level).</description>
