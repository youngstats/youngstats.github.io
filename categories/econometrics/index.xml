      <description>Recent Advancements in Applied Instrumental Variable Methods
Instrumental variables (IV) is one of most important and widespread research designs in economics and statistics, as it can identify causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. Over the past 30 years the science of IV has advanced considerably, in part through the contributions of Nobel Laureates Joshua Angrist, Guido Imbens, and James Heckman. Recent years have brought significant advances in how IV is applied, in shift-share designs, with judge or examiner instruments, and in settings with rich or complex controls.</description>

      <description>Advances in Difference-in-Differences in Econometrics
The eighth “One World webinar” organized by YoungStatS will take placeon December 15th, 2021. The difference-in-differences design is aquasi-experimental identification strategy for estimating causal effectswhich has become the single most popular research design in thequantitative social sciences, and as such, it merits careful study byresearchers everywhere. It is also a flourishing field of presentresearch in econometrics. Selected younger researchers active in thearea will present their recent contributions on this topic.</description>
