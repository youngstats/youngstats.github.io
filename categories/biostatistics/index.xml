      <description>YoungStatS project of Young Statisticians Europe, FENStatS, proudly announces our first One World YoungStatS webinar. With four young scholars, we will discuss Recent Advances in the Modelling of COVID-19, presenting novel statistical models, interesting advancements and applications of mechanistic models, as well as their combinations.
When: Wednesday, February 10th, 16:00 (Central European Time).
Speakers:
CÃ©cile Tran Kiem (Institute Pasteur, Paris, France) Pierfrancesco Alaimo Di Loro and Marco Mingione (StatGroup-19, Italy) Kevin Kunzmann (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom) Discussant:</description>

      <title>Making an Online Risk Calculator</title>

      <description>We first started making risk calculators with the website, http://nomograms.org.There are several here, and they are patient friendly.Later, we launched rcalc.ccf.org, which has many more risk calculators, although the intended audience is the clinician. It is considerably more expensive and time-consuming to make these patient friendly. There were many obstacles to overcome in making these websites. Here is an example (Figure 1), from prostate cancer research where our calculator assists with an optional treatment by showing the 4-year risks of several outcomes for both options:</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Parasites...one statistician&#39;s career journey</title>

      <description>Vector-borne diseases have long presented major challenges to the health of rural communities in the wet tropical regions of the world, but especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In this paper, we describe the contribution that statistical modelling has made to the global elimination programme for one vector-borne disease, onchocerciasis.
Perhaps more than anything else I have written, this paper captures my career journey from stochastic process theory to tropical disease epidemiology.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Treatment Selection to Benefit Patient Outcomes in Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://youngstats.github.io/post/2020/10/04/mozgunov/</link>

      <description>1Introduction: Selecting Best Treatment The question of selecting the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; amongst different choices is a common problem in our lives. In clinical trials, our main field research, the question usually translates to &amp;ldquo;Out of a number of alternative treatments, which one treats the patients best?&amp;rdquo;.
A traditional approach to answer this question is to randomise equal numbers of patients to new treatments and the current method of treatment used in practice, called standard of care (SoC).</description>

      <title>Modeling COVID-19 pandemic using Bayesian analysis with application to Slovene data</title>
      <link>https://youngstats.github.io/post/2020/10/01/modeling-covid-19/</link>

      <description>As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the world at the beginning of 2020, statistically modeling its development became of big interest. The main focus of this work was to analyze the spread of the disease and its main characteristics for Slovenia using publicly available COVID-19 data. Our work takes a Bayesian semiparametric approach using which we estimate some of the main measures of interest for the pandemic (e.g. the reproduction number $R_{t}$) and give accurate forecasts of important indicators for the following days.</description>
