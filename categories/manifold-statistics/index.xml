      <description>OverviewSets of graphs arise in many different applications, from medicine tofinance, from urban planning to social science. Analysing sets of graphsis far from trivial as they are strongly non Euclidean data type. Thereare two main sets of graphs:
labelled: where there is the same sets of nodes across eachobservation;unlabelled: where there is no clear correspondence in the nodesacross networks.Unlabelled graphs poses high challenges from both the embeddingprospective (which geometrical embedding is suitable for such graphs)and the statistical perspective (how can we extend basic tools to suchembedding).</description>
