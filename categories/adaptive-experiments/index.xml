      <description>AbstractIt is increasingly common for data to be collected adaptively, whereexperimental costs are reduced progressively by assigning promisingtreatments more frequently. However, adaptivity also poses greatchallenges on post-experiment inference, since observations aredependent, and standard estimates can be skewed and heavy-tailed. Wepropose a treatment-effect estimator that is consistent andasymptotically normal, allowing for constructing frequentist confidenceintervals and testing hypotheses.
IntroductionAdaptive data collection can optimize sample efficiency during thecourse of the experiment for particular objectives, such as identifyingthe best treatment (D.</description>
