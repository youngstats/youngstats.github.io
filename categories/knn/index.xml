      <description>Abstract Binary classification is one of the cornerstones of modern data science, but, until recently, our understanding of classical methods such as the k-nn algorithm was limited to settings where feature vectors were compactly supported. Based on a new analysis of this classifier, we propose a variant with significantly lower risk for heavy-tailed distributions.
 The \(k\)-nearest neighbour classifier The basic classifier that we consider here was introduced by Fix and Hodges (1951), and is arguably the simplest and most intuitive nonparametric classifier.</description>
