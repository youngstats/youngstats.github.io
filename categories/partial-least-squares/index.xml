      <description>We look at the problem of learning latent structure between two blocks of data through the partial least squares (PLS) approach. These methods include approaches for supervised and unsupervised statistical learning. We review these methods and present approaches to decrease the computation time and scale the method to big data
Given two blocks of data, the PLS approach seeks latent variables which are constructed as linear combinations of the original datasets.</description>
