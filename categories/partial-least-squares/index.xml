      <description>The third &amp;ldquo;One World webinar&amp;rdquo; organized by YoungStatS will take place on May 19th, 2021. The focus of this webinar will be on composite-based structural equation modeling, particularly on partial least squares path modeling (Wold, 1982; Lohm√∂ller, 1989) and approaches to assess composite models. The webinar will present some of the most interesting and recent theoretical developments and applications from younger scholars active in this area of research.

      <description>We look at the problem of learning latent structure between two blocks of data through the partial least squares (PLS) approach. These methods include approaches for supervised and unsupervised statistical learning. We review these methods and present approaches to decrease the computation time and scale the method to big data
Given two blocks of data, the PLS approach seeks latent variables which are constructed as linear combinations of the original datasets.</description>
