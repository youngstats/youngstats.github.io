      <description>OverviewThe Procrustes problem aims to match matrices using similarity transformations (i.e., rotation, reflection, translation, and scaling transformations) to minimize their Frobenius distance. It allows the comparison of matrices with dimensions defined in an arbitrary coordinate system. This method raised the interest of applied researchers, highlighting its potentiality through many applications in several fields, such as ecology, biology, analytical chemometrics, and psychometrics.
The interest of a large audience from applied fields stimulates, in parallel, the growth of a vast body of literature.</description>

      <description>Vector-borne diseases have long presented major challenges to the health of rural communities in the wet tropical regions of the world, but especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In this paper, we describe the contribution that statistical modelling has made to the global elimination programme for one vector-borne disease, onchocerciasis.
Perhaps more than anything else I have written, this paper captures my career journey from stochastic process theory to tropical disease epidemiology.</description>
