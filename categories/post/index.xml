      <description>1Introduction: Selecting Best Treatment The question of selecting the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; amongst different choices is a common problem in our lives. In clinical trials, our main field research, the question usually translates to &amp;ldquo;Out of a number of alternative treatments, which one treats the patients best?&amp;rdquo;.
A traditional approach to answer this question is to randomise equal numbers of patients to new treatments and the current method of treatment used in practice, called standard of care (SoC).</description>

      <description>Perhaps more than anything else I have written, this paper captures my career journey from stochastic process theory to tropical disease epidemiology.
In 1972 I started working towards a PhD in the then-new field of spatial statistics, and fully expected to write a thesis on stochastic process models. Instead, I spent most of the next 12 years teaching statistics at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, but my development as a researcher was driven by two periods of sabbatical leave.</description>

      <description>Program Evaluation and Causal Inference for Histogram Data
By Andrej Srakar, Valentina Prevolnik-Rupel and Tja≈°a Bartolj
Analysis of compositions, intervals, histograms, distributions and functions has become more and more common in contemporary statistics and econometrics. Despite several types of regressions existing for symbolic data, causal inference has not been studied so far adequately. We develop a statistical theory for using instrumental variables with symbolic distributional data, related to the prevailing usage of regressions in such situations, the so-called &#34;</description>
