      <description>IntroductionThe Lévy distribution, together with the Normal and Cauchy distribution,belongs to the class of stable distributions, and it is among the onlythree distributions for which the density can be derived in a closedform. The density function of the two-parameter Lévy distribution isexpressed as follows: \[\begin{equation*}f(x; \lambda, \mu)=\sqrt{\dfrac{ \lambda}{2\pi}}\frac{e^{-\dfrac{ \lambda}{2(x-\mu)}}}{(x-\mu)^{\frac{3}{2}}},\;x\geq\mu,\; \lambda&amp;gt;0, \; \mu\in \mathbb{R}.\end{equation*}\] We specifically consider the scenario where \(\mu=0\) dueto the difficulty in estimating both parameters.</description>

      <description>Exchangeable arrays have been studied since the late 70’s (Aldous (1983),Kallenberg (2005)). Eagleson and Weber (1978) and Silverman (1976) established Strong Law of LargeNumbers and Central Limit Theorems for such arrays. Because non-sparsenetworks and multiway clustering are related to exchangeable arrays,they have received recent attention in statistics and econometrics(Davezies, D’Haultfœuille, and Guyonvarch (2018), Davezies, D’Haultfœuille, and Guyonvarch (2021), Menzel (2018)). We focus below on non-sparse networksand present uniformity results at the basis of the asymptotic normalityof many nonlinear estimators.</description>
