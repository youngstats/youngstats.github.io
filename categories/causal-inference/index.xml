      <description>We address the problem of causal structure learning in the presence of hidden variables. Given a target variable $Y$, and a vector $X = (X^1, \dots, X^d)$ of $d$ covariates, we are trying to infer the set $S^* \subseteq \{1, \dots, d\}$ of observable causal parents of $Y$. There are many good reasons for being interested in causal predictors. One of them is the following well-known stability property: a regression model which regresses $Y$ on all of its causal parents remains valid under arbitrary interventions on any variable other than $Y$ itself.</description>
