      <description>Recent advances in extreme value theory
Thursday, April 20th, 6:00 PT / 9:00 ET / 15:00 CET
Extreme value theory is concerned with the accurate statistical assessment of the risk of rare events. Such extreme events have small occurrence probabilities but often entail large economic and ecological costs in addition to their potential for severe impacts on human health. There is active research to model and infer complex extremal dependence structures in multivariate data, with connections to high-dimensional statistics, machine learning and other fields.</description>

      <description>Nonparametric inference based on statistical depth
Monday, October 17th, 7:00 PT / 10:00 ET / 16:00 CET
The notion of center of an object, be it a set of observations, a physical object or a random variable, is difficult to define. This motivated the development of general ways to measure centrality via depth functions. Such mappings allow for comparing relative centrality of two locations and, consequently, providing a center-outward ordering.</description>

      <description>Recent challenges in model specification testing based on differentdata structures
Wednesday, November 9th, 8:00 PT / 11:00 ET / 17:00 CET
Model specification testing is one of the essential methodological tasksin statistics. Recently, with the development of different datastructures, envisioning concepts from classical data setups to otherenvironments becomes very important.
In the webinar, selected young statisticians will present their recentworks and elaborate on different aspects of this topic.</description>

      <description>Regularization by Noise for Stochastic Differential and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations
The regularizing effects of noisy perturbations of differential equations is a central subject of stochastic analysis. Recent breakthroughs initiated a new wave of interest, particularly concerning non-Markovian, infinite dimensional, and rough-stochastic / Young-stochastic hybrid systems.
On the webinar, selected younger scholars will present their recent works on the topic.

      <description>Theory and Methods for Inference in Multi-armed Bandit Problems
Multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms have been argued for decades as useful to conduct adaptively-randomized experiments. By skewing the allocation of the arms towards the more efficient or informative ones, they have the potential to enhance participants’ welfare, while resulting in a more flexible, efficient, and ethical alternative compared to traditional fixed studies. However, such allocation strategies complicate the problem of statistical inference.</description>

      <description>Selection of Priors in Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling
Structural equation modeling (SEM) is an important framework within the social sciences that encompasses a wide variety of statistical models. Traditionally, estimation of SEMs has relied on maximum likelihood. Unfortunately, there also exist a variety of situations in which maximum likelihood performs subpar. This led researchers to turn to alternative estimation methods, in particular, Bayesian estimation of SEMs or BSEM. However, it is currently unclear how to specify the prior distribution in order to attain the advantages of Bayesian approaches.</description>

      <description>Recent Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference
In approximate Bayesian computation, likelihood function is intractable and needs to be itself estimated using forward simulations of the statistical model (Beaumont et al., 2002; Marin et al., 2012; Sisson et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2020). Recent years have seen numerous advances in approximate inference methods, which have enabled Bayesian inference in increasingly challenging scenarios involving complex probabilistic models and large datasets.</description>

      <description>Recent Advancements in Applied Instrumental Variable Methods
Instrumental variables (IV) is one of most important and widespread research designs in economics and statistics, as it can identify causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. Over the past 30 years the science of IV has advanced considerably, in part through the contributions of Nobel Laureates Joshua Angrist, Guido Imbens, and James Heckman. Recent years have brought significant advances in how IV is applied, in shift-share designs, with judge or examiner instruments, and in settings with rich or complex controls.</description>
