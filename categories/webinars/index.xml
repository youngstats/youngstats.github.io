      <description>Inclusion Process and Sticky Brownian Motions
The ninth “One World webinar” organized by YoungStatS will take place onFebruary 9th, 2022. Inclusion process (IP) is a stochastic lattice gaswhere particles perform random walks subjected to mutual attraction. Forthe inclusion process in the condensation regime one can extract thatthe scaling limit of two particles is a pair of sticky Brownian motionswhich lead to interesting recent research.</description>

      <description>Novel Algebraic Approaches to Maximum Likelihood Estimation
The seventh “One World webinar” organized by YoungStatS will take placeon November 17th, 2021. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a tool indata analysis to estimate a probability distribution or density in astatistical model for given data. In recent decades, algebraic andcombinatorial tools have proved useful for computing MLEs andunderstanding the geometry of the MLE problem which in recent years ledto new and interesting results in combinatorics and algebraic geometry.</description>

      <description>Advancements in Symbolic Data Analysis
The sixth “One World webinar” organized by YoungStatS will take place onNovember 8th, 2021. With the development of digital systems, very largedatasets have become routine. However, standard statistical approachesdo not have the power or flexibility to analyse these efficiently, andextract the required knowledge. Symbolic Data Analysis provides aframework allowing for the representation of data with intrinsicvariability, where the observed “values” are not just single real valuesor categories, but finite sets, intervals or distributions over a givendomain.</description>

      <description>Advances in Difference-in-Differences in Econometrics
The eighth “One World webinar” organized by YoungStatS will take placeon December 15th, 2021. The difference-in-differences design is aquasi-experimental identification strategy for estimating causal effectswhich has become the single most popular research design in thequantitative social sciences, and as such, it merits careful study byresearchers everywhere. It is also a flourishing field of presentresearch in econometrics. Selected younger researchers active in thearea will present their recent contributions on this topic.</description>
