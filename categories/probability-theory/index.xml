      <description>Stochastic Fluid Dynamics
Wednesday, November 15th, 6:00 PT / 9:00 ET / 15:00 CET
The study of fluid dynamics equations with white forcing is a classical topic in SPDEs and ergodic theory. Recently a new wave of interest, with a shift in focus towards transport noise, has risen, due to its connections with Stochastic Geometric Mechanics, Turbulence, Climate Modelling, Stochastic Parametrization and Uncertainty Quantification.
In this webinar, selected young researchers will present their recent works on the topic.</description>

      <description>Meanders, monotone meanders, and Baxter permutationsVersions of the following question can be traced back at least to the work of Henri Poincaré (Poincaré (1912)):
In how many ways a simple loop in the plane can cross a line a specified number of times?
Despite many efforts, this question remains open after more than a century.Let us start by mathematically formalizing the latter question.
Definition 1.1. A meander of size \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) is a simple loop \(\ell\) (i.</description>
