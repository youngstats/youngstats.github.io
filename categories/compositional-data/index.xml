      <description>Compositional data are characterized by the fact that the relevant information is contained not necessarily in the absolute values but rather in the relative proportions between particular components. As an example, take household expenditures for different purposes (housing, groceries, travel etc.) or geochemical composition of a certain soil sample. In the latter case, the resulting composition of chemical elements is determined strongly by the particle size distribution (PSD, i.e., distribution of the size of soil grains).</description>

      <description>Correlations and negative bias&#xD;We assume that you are quite familiar with the following problem.&#xD;Consider a data set where the information is expressed in percentages or proportions.&#xD;An example are household expenditures, given as average amounts (in Euros) the households&#xD;are spending on food, housing, transportation, etc.&#xD;Since the expenditures would not be comparable among countries with very different economic&#xD;level, it makes sense to express the data as proportions (or percentages) of the single&#xD;categories on the total expenditures.</description>
