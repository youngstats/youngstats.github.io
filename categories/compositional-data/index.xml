      <description>Correlations and negative bias We assume that you are quite familiar with the following problem. Consider a data set where the information is expressed in percentages or proportions. An example are household expenditures, given as average amounts (in Euros) the households are spending on food, housing, transportation, etc. Since the expenditures would not be comparable among countries with very different economic level, it makes sense to express the data as proportions (or percentages) of the single categories on the total expenditures.</description>
