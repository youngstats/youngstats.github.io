      <description>Introduction
In the past decades, intelligent transportation system (ITS) has brought advanced technology that enables a data-rich environment and unprecedented opportunities for traffic prediction, which is considered as one of the most prevalent issues facing ITS (Li et al., 2015). We discuss the online prediction of the origin-destination (OD) demand count in traffic networks, which represents the number of trips between certain combinations of an origin and a destination. The study of OD demand prediction based on count data has a growing impact on many traffic control and management policies (Ashok, 1996, Ashok and Ben-Akiva, 2002, Li, 2005, Hazelton, 2008, Shao et al.</description>

      <description>We first started making risk calculators with the website, http://nomograms.org.There are several here, and they are patient friendly.Later, we launched rcalc.ccf.org, which has many more risk calculators, although the intended audience is the clinician. It is considerably more expensive and time-consuming to make these patient friendly. There were many obstacles to overcome in making these websites. Here is an example (Figure 1), from prostate cancer research where our calculator assists with an optional treatment by showing the 4-year risks of several outcomes for both options:</description>
