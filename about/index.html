<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>The YoungStatS Blog is set up to promote research in statistics in its broadest
sense, encompassing all of its areas and applications, among other mathematical
statistics and probability, official statistics, biostatistics and medical
statistics, social statistics, economic statistics and econometrics,
environmental statistics, statistics in natural sciences, data science and
survey methods. The intended audiences are in particular young researchers and
scholars in statistics, but also research community in statistics in general,
practitioners in the field, advisory councils, institutions, academia, the
private sector as well as journalists. The blog is hosted by Young Statisticians
Europe and its contributors are independent researchers. Their expressed
opinions in the blog posts do not necessarily reflect the opinion of Young
Statisticians Europe or FENStatS.</p>
<p><strong>Submissions</strong></p>
<p>The columns appearing on the YoungStatS Blog are commissioned by the managing
editors. Academics who are interested in writing a blog-post based on their
statistical research are encouraged to send a few lines describing the possible
column and its research basis to info(at)youngstatsblog.eu. The submission
should include information on the author(s)’ current and past affiliation(s),
relevant degrees or experiences, and the URL of the author(s)’ current webpage.</p>

<p><strong>Young Statisticians Europe (YSE)</strong></p>
<p>In October 2018, more than 20 of these representatives from 8 European countries
met for a workshop in Paris with the goal of enabling more networking,
collaboration and communication among young statisticians in Europe. The
organizing committee consists of young representatives of different statistical
association from all around Europe.</p>
<p>The goals of YSE are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To support the creation of national communities, networks and societies for
young statisticians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide a platform for networking and exchange between national young
statisticians associations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To promote joint research and academic collaboration on an international
level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To organize regional activities and events for young statistician</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To connect statisticians across different subject areas and career paths</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We organize annual events with scientific and administrative sessions. Romania
organize the second meeting in Bucharest, 1-2 November 2019. We organize some
pre-events during international conferences. For example in useR!2019 held in
Toulouse, France, from 9th to 12th July. We support the creation of new young
statistical networks. We involve people from other countries to be part of the
European group.</p>
<p>We include everyone that considers themselves to be &ldquo;young statisticians&rdquo; so for
example, master&rsquo;s students, PhD students, postdocs and people in the early
stages of their careers from academics or industry in the field of statistics.
If you want to get involved in the organizing committee of YSE, please contact
us by email and write a few sentences about yourself.</p>
<p>Every young statistician is welcomed in our
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/youngstateurope/">Facebook</a> group and our
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12206228/">LinkedIn group</a>. For communication
between the representatives from each country we have created a private facebook
group. For promoting our events we have created a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/young-statisticians-europe/">LinkedIn
